   CLER: Ay, and he will know you too, if e'er he saw you but once,
   though you should meet him at church in the midst of prayers. He is
   one of the braveries, though he be none of the wits. He will salute
   a judge upon the bench, and a bishop in the pulpit, a lawyer when
   he is pleading at the bar, and a lady when she is dancing in a
   masque, and put her out. He does give plays, and suppers, and
   invites his guests to them, aloud, out of his window, as they
   ride by in coaches. He has a lodging in the Strand for the purpose:
   or to watch when ladies are gone to the china-houses, or the
   Exchange, that he may meet them by chance, and give them presents,
   some two or three hundred pounds' worth of toys, to be laugh'd at.
   He is never without a spare banquet, or sweet-meats in his chamber,
   for their women to alight at, and come up to for a bait.
