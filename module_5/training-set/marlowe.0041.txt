     MEPHIST. As are the elements, such are the heavens,
     Even from the moon unto th' empyreal orb,
     Mutually folded in each other's spheres,
     And jointly move upon one axletree,
     Whose termine [75] is term'd the world's wide pole;
     Nor are the names of Saturn, Mars, or Jupiter
     Feign'd, but are erring [76] stars.
