   CHARLES. How fares it with my Lord high Admiral,
   Hath he been hurt with villaines in the street?
   I vow and sweare as I am King of France,
   To finde and to repay the man with death:
   With death delay'd and torments never usde,
   That durst presume for hope of any gaine,
   To hurt the noble man his sovereign loves.
