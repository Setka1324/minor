   CAR.  Nay, look you, sir, now you are a gentleman, you must carry a more
   exalted presence, change your mood and habit to a more austere form; be
   exceeding proud, stand upon your gentility, and scorn every man; speak
   nothing humbly, never discourse under a nobleman, though you never saw him
   but riding to the star-chamber, it's all one.  Love no man:  trust no man:
   speak ill of no man to his face; nor well of any man behind his back.
   Salute fairly on the front, and wish them hanged upon the turn.  Spread
   yourself upon his bosom publicly, whose heart you would eat in private.
   These be principles, think on them; I'll come to you again presently.
