_Hermes._ Why cosin, stand you building Cities here,
And beautifying the Empire of this Queene,
While _Italy_ is cleane out of thy minde?
To too forgetfull of thine owne affayres,
Why wilt thou so betray thy sonnes good hap?
The king of Gods sent me from highest heauen,
To sound this angrie message in thine eares.
Vaine man, what Monarky expectst thou here?
Or with what thought sleepst thou in _Libia_ shoare?
If that all glorie hath forsaken thee,
And thou despise the praise of such attempts:
Yet thinke vpon _Ascanius_ prophesie,
And yong _Iulus_ more then thousand yeares,
Whom I haue brought from _Ida_ where he slept,
And bore yong _Cupid_ vnto _Cypresse_ Ile.
