   FAST.  Faith, sir, the same that sundered Agamemnon and great Thetis' son;
   but let the cause escape, sir:  he sent me a challenge, mixt with some few
   braves, which I restored, and in fine we met.  Now, indeed, sir, I must
   tell you, he did offer at first very desperately, but without judgment:
   for, look you, sir, I cast myself into this figure; now he comes violently
   on, and withal advancing his rapier to strike, I thought to have took his
   arm, for he had left his whole body to my election, and I was sure he could
   not recover his guard.  Sir, I mist my purpose in his arm, rash'd his
   doublet-sleeve, ran him close by the left cheek, and through his hair.  He
   again lights me here, -- I had on a gold cable hatband, then new come up,
   which I wore about a murey French hat I had, -- cuts my hatband, and yet it
   was massy goldsmith's work, cuts my brims, which by good fortune, being
   thick embroidered with gold twist and spangles, disappointed the force of
   the blow:  nevertheless, it grazed on my shoulder, takes me away six purls
   of an Italian cut-work band I wore, cost me three pound in the Exchange but
   three days before.
