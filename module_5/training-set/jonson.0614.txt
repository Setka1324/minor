   TRUE: The doing of it, not the manner: that must be private. Many
   things that seem foul in the doing, do please done. A lady
   should, indeed, study her face, when we think she sleeps; nor,
   when the doors are shut, should men be enquiring; all is sacred
   within, then. Is it for us to see their perukes put on, their
   false teeth, their complexion, their eye-brows, their nails? You
   see guilders will not work, but inclosed. They must not discover
   how little serves, with the help of art, to adorn a great deal.
   How long did the canvas hang afore Aldgate? Were the people
   suffered to see the city's Love and Charity, while they were rude
   stone, before they were painted and burnish'd? No: no more should
   Servants approach their mistresses, but when they are complete and
   finish'd.
