_Ã†n._ _Achates_, tis my mother that is fled,
I know her by the mouings of her feete:
Stay gentle _Venus_, flye not from thy sonne,
Too cruell, why wilt thou forsake me thus?
Or in these shades deceiu'st mine eye so oft?
Why talke we not together hand in hand?
And tell our griefes in more familiar termes:
But thou art gone and leau'st me here alone,
To dull the ayre with my discoursiue moane. _Exit_.
