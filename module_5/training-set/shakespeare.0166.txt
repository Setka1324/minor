    [Footnote I.32: _I am too much i'the sun._] Meaning, probably,
    his being sent for from his studies to be exposed at his uncle's
    marriage as his _chiefest courtier_, and being thereby placed too
    much in the radiance of the king's presence; or, perhaps, an
    allusion to the proverb, "_Out of Heaven's blessing, into the
    warm sun:_" but it is not unlikely that a quibble is meant
    between _son_ and _sun_.]
