_War._ Upon him, soldiers! take away his weapons!
_Y. Mor._ Thou proud disturber of thy country's peace,
   Corrupter of thy king, cause of these broils,
   Base flatterer, yield! and, were it not for shame,
   Shame and dishonour to a soldier's name,
   Upon my weapon's point here shouldst thou fall,
   And welter in thy gore.
_Lan._ Monster of men,
   That, like the Greekish strumpet, train'd to arms
   And bloody wars so many valiant knights,
   Look for no other fortune, wretch, than death!
   King Edward is not here to buckler thee.
_War._ Lancaster, why talk'st thou to the slave?--
   Go, soldiers, take him hence; for, by my sword,
   His head shall off.--Gaveston, short warning
   Shall serve thy turn: it is our country's cause
   That here severely we will execute
   Upon thy person.--Hang him at a bough.
_Gav._ My lord,--
_War._ Soldiers, have him away.--
   But, for thou wert the favourite of a king,
   Thou shalt have so much honour at our hands.
_Gav._ I thank you all, my lords: then I perceive
   That heading is one, and hanging is the other,
   And death is all.
