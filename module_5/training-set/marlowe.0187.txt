_Y. Mor._ Look, Lancaster, yonder is Edward
   Among his flatterers.
_Lan._And there let him be,
   Till he pay dearly for their company.
_War._ And shall, or Warwick's sword shall smite in vain.
_K. Edw._ What, rebels, do you shrink and sound retreat?
_Y. Mor._ No, Edward, no; thy flatterers faint and fly.
_Lan._ They'd best betimes forsake thee and their trains,
   For they'll betray thee, traitors as they are.
_Y. Spen._ Traitor on thy face, rebellious Lancaster!
_Pem._ Away, base upstart! brav'st thou nobles thus?
_E. Spen._ A noble attempt and honourable deed,
   Is it not, trow ye, to assemble aid
   And levy arms against your lawful king?
_K. Edw._ For which, ere long, their heads shall satisfy
   T' appease the wrath of their offended king.
_Y. Mor._ Then, Edward, thou wilt fight it to the last,
   And rather bathe thy sword in subjects' blood
   Than banish that pernicious company?
_K. Edw._ Ay, traitors all, rather than thus be brav'd,
   Make England's civil towns huge heaps of stones,
   And ploughs to go about our palace-gates.
_War._ A desperate and unnatural resolution!--
   Alarum to the fight!
   Saint George for England, and the barons' right!
_K. Edw._ Saint George for England, and King Edward's right!
                           [_Alarums.  Exeunt the two parties severally._
