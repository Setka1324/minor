  _1st Play._ (L.) _Anon he finds him
  Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
  Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
  Repugnant to command: Unequal match'd,
  Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
  But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword[61]
  The unnerved father falls.
  But, as we often see, against some storm,
  A silence in the heavens, the rack[62] stand still,
  The bold wind speechless, and the orb below
  As hush as death; anon the dreadful thunder
  Doth rend the region; So, after Pyrrhus' pause,
  A roused vengeance sets him new a work;
  And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
  On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
  With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
  Now falls on Priam.--
  Out, out, thou fickle Fortune!_
