   CHARLES. Assure your selfe my good Lord Admirall,
   I deepely sorrow for your trecherous wrong:
   And that I am not more secure my selfe,
   Then I am carefull you should be preserved.
   Cossin, take twenty of our strongest guarde,
   And under your direction see they keep
   All trecherous violence from our noble freend,
   Repaying all attempts with present death,
   Upon the cursed breakers of our peace.
   And so be pacient good Lord Admirall,
   And every hower I will visite you.
