_Dido._ I feare I sawe _Æneas_ little sonne,
Led by _Achates_ to the Troian fleete:
If it be so, his father meanes to flye:
But here he is, now _Dido_ trie thy wit.
_Æneas_, wherefore goe thy men abourd?,
Why are thy ships new rigd? or to what end
Launcht from the hauen, lye they in the Rhode?
Pardon me though I aske, loue makes me aske.
