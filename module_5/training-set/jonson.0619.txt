   PAGE: Why, sir, he hath chosen a street to lie in so narrow at both
   ends, that it will receive no coaches, nor carts, nor any of these
   common noises: and therefore we that love him, devise to bring him
   in such as we may, now and then, for his exercise, to breathe him.
   He would grow resty else in his ease: his virtue would rust without
   action. I entreated a bearward, one day, to come down with the
   dogs of some four parishes that way, and I thank him he did;
   and cried his games under master Morose's window: till he was
   sent crying away, with his head made a most bleeding spectacle to
   the multitude. And, another time, a fencer marchng to his prize, had
   his drum most tragically run through, for taking that street in his
   way at my request.
