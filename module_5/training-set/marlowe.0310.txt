_Iup._ What? dares she strike the darling of my thoughts?
By _Saturnes_ soule, and this earth threatning aire,
That shaken thrise, makes Natures buildings quake,
I vow, if she but once frowne on thee more,
To hang her meteor like twixt heauen and earth,
And bind her hand and foote with golden cordes,
As once I did for harming _Hercules_.
