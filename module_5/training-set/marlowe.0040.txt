     FAUSTUS. My heart is harden'd, I cannot repent;
     Scarce can I name salvation, faith, or heaven:
     Swords, poisons, halters, and envenom'd steel
     Are laid before me to despatch myself;
     And long ere this I [74] should have done the deed,
     Had not sweet pleasure conquer'd deep despair.
     Have not I made blind Homer sing to me
     Of Alexander's love and Oenon's death?
     And hath not he, that built the walls of Thebes
     With ravishing sound of his melodious harp,
     Made music with my Mephistophilis?
     Why should I die, then, or basely despair?
     I am resolv'd; Faustus shall not repent.--
     Come, Mephistophilis, let us dispute again,
     And reason of divine astrology.
     Speak, are there many spheres above the moon?
     Are all celestial bodies but one globe,
     As is the substance of this centric earth?
