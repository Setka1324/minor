_Dido._ Then neuer say that thou art miserable,
Because it may be thou shalt be my loue:
Yet boast not of it, for I loue thee not,
And yet I hate thee not: O if I speake
I shall betray my selfe: _Ã†neas_ speake,
We two will goe a hunting in the woods,
But not so much for thee, thou art but one,
As for _Achates_, and his followers.   _Exeunt._
