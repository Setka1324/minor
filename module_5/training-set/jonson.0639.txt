   TRUE: Then, if you love your wife, or rather dote on her, sir: O, how
   she'll torture you! and take pleasure in your torments! you shall
   lie with her but when she lists; she will not hurt her beauty, her
   complexion; or it must be for that jewel, or that pearl, when she
   does: every half hour's pleasure must be bought anew: and with the
   same pain and charge you woo'd her at first. Then you must
   keep what servants she please; what company she will; that friend
   must not visit you without her license; and him she loves most, she
   will seem to hate eagerliest, to decline your jealousy; or, feign
   to be jealous of you first; and for that cause go live with her
   she-friend, or cousin at the college, that can instruct her in all
   the mysteries of writing letters, corrupting servants, taming
   spies; where she must have that rich gown for such a great day; a
   new one for the next; a richer for the third; be served in silver;
   have the chamber fill'd with a succession of grooms, footmen,
   ushers, and other messengers; besides embroiderers, jewellers,
   tire-women, sempsters, feathermen, perfumers; whilst she feels not
   how the land drops away; nor the acres melt; nor foresees the
   change, when the mercer has your woods for her velvets; never
   weighs what her pride costs, sir: so she may kiss a page, or a
   smooth chin, that has the despair of a beard; be a stateswoman,
   know all the news, what was done at Salisbury, what at the Bath,
   what at court, what in progress; or, so she may censure poets, and
   authors, and styles, and compare them, Daniel with Spenser, Jonson
   with the t'other youth, and so forth: or be thought cunning in
   controversies, or the very knots of divinity; and have often in
   her mouth the state of the question: and then skip to the
   mathematics, and demonstration: and answer in religion to one,
   in state to another, in bawdry to a third.
