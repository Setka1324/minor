   FAL.  Sweet heart!  O, better still!
   And asking, why?  wherefore?  and looking strangely,
   As if he were as white as innocence!
   Alas, you're simple, you:  you cannot change,
   Look pale at pleasure, and then red with wonder;
   No, no, not you!  'tis pity o' your naturals.
   I did but cast an amorous eye, e'en now,
   Upon a pair of gloves that somewhat liked me,
   And straight he noted it, and gave command
   All should be ta'en away.
