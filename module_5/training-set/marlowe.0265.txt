   QUEENE MOTHER. My Lord Cardinall of Loraine, tell me,
   How likes your grace my sonnes pleasantnes?
   His mince you see runnes on his minions,
   And all his heaven is to delight himselfe:
   And whilste he sleepes securely thus in ease,
   Thy brother Guise and we may now provide,
   To plant our selves with such authoritie,
   That not a man may live without our leaves.
   Then shall the Catholick faith of Rome,
   Flourish in France, and none deny the same.
