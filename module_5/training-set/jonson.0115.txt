OVER. I cannot beget a project, with all my political brain yet: my
project is how to fetch off this proper young man from his debauched
company. I have followed him all the Fair over, and still I find him
with this songster, and I begin shrewdly to suspect their familiarity;
and the young man of a terrible taint, poetry! with which idle disease
if he be infected, there's no hope of him, in a state-course. _Actum
est_ of him for a commonwealth's-man, if he go to't in rhyme once.
