   MACI.  Such a wife!  Now hate me, sir, if ever I discern'd any wonder in
   your wife yet, with all the speculation I have:  I have seen some that have
   been thought fairer than she, in my time; and I have seen those, have not
   been altogether so tall, esteem'd properer women; and I have seen less
   noses grow upon sweeter faces, that have done very well too, in my
   judgment.  But in good faith, signior, for all this, the gentlewoman is a
   good, pretty, proud, hard-favour'd thing, marry not so peerlessly to be
   doted upon, I must confess:  nay, be not angry.
