     FAUSTUS. What art thou, Faustus, but a man condemn'd to die?
     Thy fatal time draws to a final end;
     Despair doth drive distrust into my thoughts:
     Confound these passions with a quiet sleep:
     Tush, Christ did call the thief upon the Cross;
     Then rest thee, Faustus, quiet in conceit.
          [He sits to sleep.]
