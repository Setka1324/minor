     BENVOLIO. Away! you love me not, to urge me thus:
     Shall I let slip so great an injury,
     When every servile groom jests at my wrongs,
     And in their rustic gambols proudly say,
     "Benvolio's head was grac'd with horns today?"
     O, may these eyelids never close again,
     Till with my sword I have that [176] conjurer slain!
     If you will aid me in this enterprise,
     Then draw your weapons and be resolute;
     If not, depart:  here will Benvolio die,
     But Faustus' death shall quit my [177] infamy.
