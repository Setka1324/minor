   CAR.  He's gone now, I thought he would fly out presently.  These be our
   nimble-spirited catsos, that have their evasions at pleasure, will run over
   a bog like your wild Irish; no sooner started, but they'll leap from one
   thing to another, like a squirrel, heigh!  dance and do tricks in their
   discourse, from fire to water, from water to air, from air to earth, as if
   their tongues did but e'en lick the four elements over, and away.
