     Come, German Valdes, and Cornelius,
     And make me blest [16] with your sage conference.
     Valdes, sweet Valdes, and Cornelius,
     Know that your words have won me at the last
     To practice magic and concealed arts.
     Philosophy is odious and obscure;
     Both law and physic are for petty wits:
     'Tis magic, magic that hath ravish'd me.
     Then, gentle friends, aid me in this attempt;
     And I, that have with subtle syllogisms
     Gravell'd the pastors of the German church,
     And made the flowering pride of Wittenberg
     Swarm [17] to my problems, as th' infernal spirits
     On sweet Musaeus when he came to hell,
     Will be as cunning as Agrippa was,
     Whose shadow made all Europe honour him.
