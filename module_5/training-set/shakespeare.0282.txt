    [Footnote III.98: _"While the grass grows,"--the proverb is
    something musty._] The proverb is, "_While the grass grows, the
    steed starves._" Hamlet alludes to his own position, while
    waiting for his succession to the throne of Denmark. A similar
    adage is, "_A slip between the cup and the lip._"]
