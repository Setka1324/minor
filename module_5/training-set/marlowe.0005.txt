     If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and there
     is no truth in us.  Why, then, belike we must sin, and so
     consequently die:
     Ay, we must die an everlasting death.
     What doctrine call you this, Che sera, sera,
     What will be, shall be?  Divinity, adieu!
     These metaphysics of magicians,
     And necromantic books are heavenly;
     Lines, circles, scenes, letters, and characters; [10]
     Ay, these are those that Faustus most desires.
     O, what a world of profit and delight,
     Of power, of honour, and omnipotence,
     Is promis'd to the studious artizan!
     All things that move between the quiet poles
     Shall be at my command:  emperors and kings
     Are but obeyed in their several provinces;
     But his dominion that exceeds in this,
     Stretcheth as far as doth the mind of man;
     A sound magician is a demigod:
     Here tire, my brains, to gain [11] a deity.
