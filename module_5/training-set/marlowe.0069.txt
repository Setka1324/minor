     MEPHIST. Faustus, thou shalt:  then kneel down presently,
     Whilst on thy head I lay my hand,
     And charm thee with this magic wand.
     First, wear this girdle; then appear
     Invisible to all are here:
     The planets seven, the gloomy air,
     Hell, and the Furies' forked hair,
     Pluto's blue fire, and Hecat's tree,
     With magic spells so compass thee,
     That no eye may thy body see!
     So, Faustus, now, for all their holiness,
     Do what thou wilt, thou shalt not be discern'd.
