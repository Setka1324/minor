   DUCHESSE. That I may write unto my dearest Lord.
   Sweet Mugeroune, tis he that hath my heart,
   And Guise usurpes it, cause I am his wife:
   Faine would I finde some means to speak with him
   But cannot, and therfore am enforst to write,
   That he may come and meet me in some place,
   Where we may one injoy the others sight.
