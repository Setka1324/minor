    [_Crosses to_ L.]
                           I pray you all,
  If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
  Let it be tenable[64] in your silence still;
  And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
  Give it an understanding, but no tongue;
  I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
  Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
  I'll visit you.
