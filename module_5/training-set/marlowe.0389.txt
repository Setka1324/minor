_Dido._ Not all the world can take thee from mine armes,
_Ã†neas_ may commaund as many Moores,
As in the Sea are little water drops:
And now to make experience of my loue,
Faire sister _Anna_ leade my louer forth,
And seated on my Gennet, let him ride
As _Didos_ husband through the punicke streetes,
And will my guard with Mauritanian darts,
To waite vpon him as their soueraigne Lord.
