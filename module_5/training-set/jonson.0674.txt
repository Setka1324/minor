   DAUP: Marry sir, get me your pheasants, and your godwits, and your
   best meat, and dish it in silver dishes of your cousin's presently,
   and say nothing, but clap me a clean towel about you, like a sewer;
   and bare-headed, march afore it with a good confidence, ('tis but
   over the way, hard by,) and we'll second you, where you shall set
   it on the board, and bid them welcome to't, which shall shew 'tis
   yours, and disgrace his preparation utterly: and, for your cousin,
   whereas she should be troubled here at home with care of making and
   giving welcome, she shall transfer all that labour thither, and be
   a principal guest herself, sit rank'd with the college-honours, and
   be honour'd, and have her health drunk as often, as bare and as
   loud as the best of them.
