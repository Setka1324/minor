Come, sir, set it here, did not I bid you should get a chair let out
o' the sides for me, that my hips might play? you'll never think of
any thing, till your dame be rump-gall'd; 'tis well, changeling:
because it can take in your grasshopper's thighs, you care for no
more. Now, you look as you had been in the corner of the booth,
fleaing your breech with a candle's end, and set fire o' the Fair.
Fill, Stote, fill.
