BUSY. Peace, with thy apocryphal wares, thou profane publican; thy
bells, thy dragons, and thy Tobie's dogs. Thy hobby-horse is an idol,
a very idol, a fierce and rank idol; and thou, the Nebuchadnezzar, the
proud Nebuchadnezzar of the Fair, that sett'st it up, for children to
fall down to, and worship.
