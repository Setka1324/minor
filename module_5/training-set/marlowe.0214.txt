_Archb. of Cant._ Long live King Edward, by the grace of God
   King of England and Lord of Ireland!
_Cham._ If any Christian, Heathen, Turk, or Jew,
   Dares but affirm that Edward's not true king,
   And will avouch his saying with the sword,
   I am the Champion that will combat him.
_Y. Mor._ None comes: sound, trumpets!                       [_Trumpets._
_K. Edw. Third._ Champion, here's to thee.                [_Gives purse._
_Q. Isab._ Lord Mortimer, now take him to your charge.
