_Dido._  _Æneas_, Ile repaire thy Troian ships,
Conditionally that thou wilt stay with me,
And let _Achates_ saile to _Italy_:
Ile giue thee tackling made of riueld gold,
Wound on the barkes of odoriferous trees,
Oares of massie Iuorie full of holes,
Through which the water shall delight to play:
Thy Anchors shall be hewed from Christall Rockes,
Which if thou lose shall shine aboue the waues;
The Masts whereon thy swelling sailes shall hang,
Hollow Pyramides of siluer plate:
The sailes of foulded Lawne, where shall be wrought
The warres of _Troy_, but not _Troyes_ ouerthrow:
For ballace, emptie _Didos_ treasurie,
Take what ye will, but leaue _Æneas_ here.
_Achates_, thou shalt be so meanly clad,
As Seaborne Nymphes shall swarme about thy ships,
And wanton Mermaides court thee with sweete songs,
Flinging in fauours of more soueraigne worth,
Then _Thetis_ hangs about _Apolloes_ necke,
So that _Æneas_ may but stay with me.
