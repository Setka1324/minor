_Venus._ Sister of _Ioue_, if that thy loue be such,
As these thy protestations doe paint forth,
We two as friends one fortune will deuide:
_Cupid_ shall lay his arrowes in thy lap,
And to a Scepter chaunge his golden shafts,
Fancie and modestie shall liue as mates,
And thy faire peacockes by my pigeons pearch:
Loue my _Ã†neas_, and desire is thine,
The day, the night, my Swannes, my sweetes are thine.
