LIT. Stirring! yes, and studying an old elder come from Banbury, a
suitor that puts in here at meal tide, to praise the painful brethren,
or pray that the sweet singers may be restored; says a grace as long

it gets quite out of him, and then my mother, or Win, are fain to
fetch it again with malmsey or aqua coelestis.
