   ANJOY. My Lords of Poland I must needs confesse,
   The offer of your Prince Elector's, farre
   Beyond the reach of my desertes:
   For Poland is as I have been enformde,
   A martiall people, worthy such a King,
   As hath sufficient counsaile in himselfe,
   To lighten doubts and frustrate subtile foes.
   And such a King whom practice long hath taught,
   To please himselfe with mannage of the warres,
   The greatest warres within our Christian bounds,
   I meane our warres against the Muscovites:
   And on the other side against the Turke,
   Rich Princes both, and mighty Emperours:
   Yet by my brother Charles our King of France,
   And by his graces councell it is thought,
   That if I undertake to weare the crowne
   Of Poland, it may prejudice their hope
   Of my inheritance to the crowne of France:
   For if th'almighty take my brother hence,
   By due discent the Regall seat is mine.
   With Poland therfore must I covenant thus,
   That if by death of Charles, the diadem
   Of France be cast on me, then with your leaves
   I may retire me to my native home.
   If your commission serve to warrant this,
   I thankfully shall undertake the charge
   Of you and yours, and carefully maintaine
   The wealth and safety of your kingdomes right.
