_Æn._ Triumph my mates, our trauels are at end,
Here will _Æneas_ build a statelier _Troy_,
Then that which grim _Atrides_ ouerthrew:
_Carthage_ shall vaunt her pettie walles no more,
For I will grace them with a fairer frame,
And clad her in a Chrystall liuerie,
Wherein the day may euermore delight:
From golden _India Ganges_ will I fetch,
Whose wealthie streames may waite vpon her towers,
And triple wise intrench her round about:
The Sunne from Egypt shall rich odors bring,
Wherewith his burning beames like labouring Bees,
That loade their thighes with _Hyblas_ honeys spoyles,
Shall here vnburden their exhaled sweetes,
And plant our pleasant suburbes with her fumes.
