GRACE. If you both love me, as you pretend, your own reason will tell
you, but one can enjoy me: and to that point there leads a directer
line, than by my infamy, which must follow, if you fight. 'Tis true, I
have profest it to you ingenuously, that rather than to be yoked with
this bridegroom is appointed me, I would take up any husband almost
upon any trust; though subtlety would say to me, I know, he is a fool,
and has an estate, and I might govern him, and enjoy a friend beside:
but these are not my aims; I must have a husband I must love, or I
cannot live with him. I shall ill make one of these politic wives.
