KNOCK. How now! my galloway nag the staggers, ha! Whit, give him a
slit in the forehead. Chear up, man; a needle and thread to stitch his
ears. I'd cure him now, an I had it, with a little butter and garlick,
long pepper and grains. Where's my horn? I'll give him a mash
presently, shall take away this dizziness.
