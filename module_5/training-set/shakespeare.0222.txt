  _King._                Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
  For we have closely sent[4] for Hamlet hither,
  That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
  Affront Ophelia:[5]
  Her father and myself (lawful espials[6]),
  Will so bestow ourselves, that, seeing, unseen,
  We may of their encounter frankly judge;
  And gather by him, as he is behaved,
  If't be the affliction of his love or no
  That thus he suffers for.
