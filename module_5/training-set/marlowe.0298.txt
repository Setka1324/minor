   KING. Brother of Navarre, I sorrow much,
   That ever I was prov'd your enemy,
   And that the sweet and princely minde you beare,
   Was ever troubled with injurious warres:
   I vow as I am lawfull King of France,
   To recompence your reconciled love,
   With all the honors and affections,
   That ever I vouchsafte my dearest freends.
