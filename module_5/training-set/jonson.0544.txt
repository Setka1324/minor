   Never till now did object greet mine eyes
   With any light content:  but in her graces
   All my malicious powers have lost their stings.
   Envy is fled from my soul at sight of her,
   And she hath chased all black thoughts from my bosom,
   Like as the sun doth darkness from the world,
   My stream of humour is run out of me,
   And as our city's torrent, bent t'infect
   The hallow'd bowels of the silver Thames,
   Is check'd by strength and clearness of the river,
   Till it hath spent itself even at the shore;
   So in the ample and unmeasured flood
   Of her perfections, are my passions drown'd;
   And I have now a spirit as sweet and clear
   As the more rarefied and subtle air: --
   With which, and with a heart as pure as fire,
   Yet humble as the earth, do I implore
   [KNEELS.
   O heaven, that She, whose presence hath effected
   This change in me, may suffer most late change
   In her admired and happy government:
   May still this Island be call'd Fortunate,
   And rugged Treason tremble at the sound,
   When Fame shall speak it with an emphasis.
   Let foreign polity be dull as lead,
   And pale Invasion come with half a heart,
   When he but looks upon her blessed soil.
   The throat of War be stopt within her land,
   And turtle-footed Peace dance fairy rings
   About her court; where never may there come
   Suspect or danger, but all trust and safety.
   Let Flattery be dumb, and Envy blind
   In her dread presence; Death himself admire her;
   And may her virtues make him to forget
   The use of his inevitable hand.
   Fly from her, Age; sleep, Time, before her throne;
   Our strongest wall falls down, when she is gone.
