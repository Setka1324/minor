LEATH. _Now, gentles, to the friends, who in number are two,
  And lodged in that ale-house in which fair Hero does do.
  Damon, for some kindness done him the last week,
  Is come, fair Hero, in Fish-street, this morning to seek:
  Pythias does smell the knavery of the meeting,
  And now you shall see their true-friendly greeting._
