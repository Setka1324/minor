   CAR.  A pimp, a pimp, that I have observed yonder, the rarest superficies
   of a humour; he comes every morning to empty his lungs in Paul's here; and
   offers up some five or six hecatombs of faces and sighs, and away again.
   Here he comes; nay, walk, walk, be not seen to note him, and we shall have
   excellent sport.
