  _King._ Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply;
  Be as ourself in Denmark.--Madam, come;
  This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
  Sits smiling to my heart:[43] in grace whereof,[44]
  No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,[45]
  But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell;
  Re-speaking earthly thunder.
