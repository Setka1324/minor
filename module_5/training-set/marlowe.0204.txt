_K. Edw._ Such news as I expect.--Come, Berkeley, come,
   And tell thy message to my naked breast.
_Berk._ My lord, think not a thought so villanous
   Can harbour in a man of noble birth.
   To do your highness service and devoir,
   And save you from your foes, Berkeley would die.
_Leices._ My lord, the council of the queen command
   That I resign my charge.
_K. Edw._ And who must keep me now?  Must you, my lord?
_Berk._ Ay, my most gracious lord; so 'tis decreed.
_K. Edw._ [_Taking the paper._]  By Mortimer, whose name is written here!
   Well may I rent his name that rends my heart.             [_Tears it._
   This poor revenge hath something eas'd my mind:
   So may his limbs be torn as is this paper!
   Hear me, immortal Jove, and grant it too!
_Berk._ Your grace must hence with me to Berkeley straight.
_K. Edw._ Whither you will: all places are alike,
   And every earth is fit for burial.
_Leices._ Favour him, my lord, as much as lieth in you.
_Berk._ Even so betide my soul as I use him!
_K. Edw._ Mine enemy hath pitied my estate,
   And that's the cause that I am now remov'd.
_Berk._ And thinks your grace that Berkeley will be cruel?
_K. Edw._ I know not; but of this am I assur'd,
   That death ends all, and I can die but once.--
   Leicester, farewell.
_Leices._ Not yet, my lord; I'll bear you on your way.         [_Exeunt._
