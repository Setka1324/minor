   MOR: O, no! there is such a noise in the court, that they have
   frighted me home with more violence then I went! such speaking
   and counter-speaking, with their several voices of citations,
   appellations, allegations, certificates, attachments,
   intergatories, references, convictions, and afflictions indeed,
   among the doctors and proctors, that the noise here is silence
   to't! a kind of calm midnight!
