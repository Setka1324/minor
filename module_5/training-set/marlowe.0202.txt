_Mow._ Upon my life, these be the men ye seek.
_Rice._ Fellow, enough.--My lord, I pray, be short;
   A fair commission warrants what we do.
_Leices._ The queen's commission, urg'd by Mortimer:
   What cannot gallant Mortimer with the queen?--
   Alas, see where he sits, and hopes unseen
   T'escape their hands that seek to reave his life!
   Too true it is, _Quem dies vidit veniens superbum,
   Hunc dies vidit fugiens jacentem._
   But, Leicester, leave to grow so passionate.--
   Spenser and Baldock, by no other names,
   I arrest you of high treason here.
   Stand not on titles, but obey th' arrest:
   'Tis in the name of Isabel the queen.--
   My lord, why droop you thus?
_K. Edw._ O day, the last of all my bliss on earth!
   Centre of all misfortune!  O my stars,
   Why do you lour unkindly on a king?
   Comes Leicester, then, in Isabella's name,
   To take my life, my company from me?
   Here, man, rip up this panting breast of mine,
   And take my heart in rescue of my friends.
_Rice._ Away with them!
_Y. Spen._ It may become thee yet
   To let us take our farewell of his grace.
_Abbott._ My heart with pity earns to see this sight;
   A king to bear these words and proud commands!               [_Aside._
_K. Edw._ Spenser, ah, sweet Spenser, thus, then, must we part?
_Y. Spen._ We must, my lord; so will the angry heavens.
_K. Edw._ Nay, so will hell and cruel Mortimer:
   The gentle heavens have not to do in this.
_Bald._ My lord, it is in vain to grieve or storm.
   Here humbly of your grace we take our leaves:
   Our lots are cast; I fear me, so is thine.
_K. Edw._ In heaven we may, in earth ne'er shall we meet:--
   And, Leicester, say, what shall become of us?
_Leices._ Your majesty must go to Killingworth.
_K. Edw._ Must! it is somewhat hard when kings must go.
_Leices._ Here is a litter ready for your grace,
   That waits your pleasure, and the day grows old.
_Rice._ As good be gone, as stay and be benighted.
_K. Edw._ A litter hast thou? lay me in a hearse,
   And to the gates of hell convey me hence;
   Let Pluto's bells ring out my fatal knell,
   And hags howl for my death at Charon's shore;
   For friends hath Edward none but these,
   And these must die under a tyrant's sword.
_Rice._ My lord, be going: care not for these;
   For we shall see them shorter by the heads.
_K. Edw._ Well, that shall be shall be: part we must;
   Sweet Spenser, gentle Baldock, part we must.--
   Hence, feigned weeds! unfeigned are my woes.--
                                            [_Throwing off his disguise._
   Father, farewell.--Leicester, thou stay'st for me;
   And go I must.--Life, farewell, with my friends!
                                     [_Exeunt King Edward and Leicester._
_Y. Spen._ O, is he gone?  is noble Edward gone?
   Parted from hence, never to see us more!
   Rend, sphere of heaven! and, fire, forsake thy orb!
   Earth, melt to air! gone is my sovereign,
   Gone, gone, alas, never to make return!
_Bald._ Spenser, I see our souls are fleeting hence;
   We are depriv'd the sunshine of our life.
   Make for a new life, man; throw up thy eyes
   And heart and hand to heaven's immortal throne;
   Pay nature's debt with cheerful countenance;
   Reduce we all our lessons unto this,--
   To die, sweet Spenser, therefore live we all;
   Spenser, all live to die, and rise to fall.
_Rice._ Come, come, keep these preachments till you come to
   the place appointed.  You, and such as you are, have
   made wise work in England.  Will your lordships away?
_Mow._ Your lordship I trust will remember me?
_Rice._ Remember thee, fellow! what else?  Follow me to
   the town.                                                   [_Exeunt._
