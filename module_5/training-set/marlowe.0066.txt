     POPE. It is enough.  Here, take him to your charge,
     And bear him straight to Ponte [125] Angelo,
     And in the strongest tower enclose him fast.
     To-morrow, sitting in our consistory,
     With all our college of grave cardinals,
     We will determine of his life or death.
     Here, take his [126] triple crown along with you,
     And leave it in the church's treasury.
     Make haste again, my good Lord Cardinals,
     And take our blessing apostolical.
