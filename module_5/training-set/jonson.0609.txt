   TRUE: Why, is it not arrived there yet, the news? A new foundation,
   sir, here in the town, of ladies, that call themselves the
   collegiates, an order between courtiers and country-madams,
   that live from their husbands; and give entertainment to all the
   wits, and braveries of the time, as they call them: cry down, or
   up, what they like or dislike in a brain or a fashion, with most
   masculine, or rather hermaphroditical authority; and every day
   gain to their college some new probationer.
