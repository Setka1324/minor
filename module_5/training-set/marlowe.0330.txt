_Ã†n._ O my _Achates_, Theban _Niobe_,
Who for her sonnes death wept out life and breath,
And drie with griefe was turnd into a stone,
Had not such passions in her head as I.
Me thinkes that towne there should be _Troy_, yon _Idas_ hill,
There _Zanthus_ streame, because here's _Priamus_,
And when I know it is not, then I dye.
