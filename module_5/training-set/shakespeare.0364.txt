    [Footnote V.58: _I dare not--lest I should compare--were to know
    himself._] No one can have a perfect conception of the measure of
    another's excellence, unless he shall himself come up to that
    standard. Dr. Johnson says, I dare not pretend to know him, lest
    I should pretend to an equality: no man can completely know
    another, but by knowing himself, which is the utmost extent of
    human wisdom.]
