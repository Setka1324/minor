_Q. Isab._ My lord, 'tis thought the earls are up in arms.
_K. Edw._ Ay, and 'tis likewise thought you favour 'em.
_Q. Isab._ Thus do you still suspect me without cause.
_Niece._ Sweet uncle, speak more kindly to the queen.
_Gav._ My lord, dissemble with her; speak her fair.
_K. Edw._ Pardon me, sweet; I forgot myself.
_Q. Isab._ Your pardon is quickly got of Isabel.
_K. Edw._ The younger Mortimer is grown so brave,
   That to my face he threatens civil wars.
_Gav._ Why do you not commit him to the Tower?
_K. Edw._ I dare not, for the people love him well.
_Gav._ Why, then, we'll have him privily made away.
_K. Edw._ Would Lancaster and he had both carous'd
   A bowl of poison to each other's health!
   But let them go, and tell me what are these.
_Niece._ Two of my father's servants whilst he liv'd:
   May't please your grace to entertain them now.
_K. Edw._ Tell me, where wast thou born? what is thine arms?
_Bald._ My name is Baldock, and my gentry
   I fetch from Oxford, not from heraldry.
_K. Edw._ The fitter art thou, Baldock, for my turn.
   Wait on me, and I'll see thou shalt not want.
_Bald._ I humbly thank your majesty.
_K. Edw._ Knowest thou him, Gaveston.
_Gav._ Ay, my lord;
   His name is Spenser; he is well allied:
   For my sake let him wait upon your grace;
   Scarce shall you find a man of more desert.
_K. Edw._ Then, Spenser, wait upon me for his sake:
   I'll grace thee with a higher style ere long.
_Y. Spen._ No greater titles happen unto me
   Than to be favour'd of your majesty!
_K. Edw._ Cousin, this day shall be your marriage feast:--
   And, Gaveston, think that I love thee well,
   To wed thee to our niece, the only heir
   Unto the Earl of Glocester late deceas'd.
_Gav._ I know, my lord, many will stomach me;
   But I respect neither their love nor hate.
_K. Edw._ The headstrong barons shall not limit me;
   He that I list to favour shall be great.
   Come, let's away; and, when the marriage ends,
   Have at the rebels and their complices!                     [_Exeunt._
