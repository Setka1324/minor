     FAUSTUS. These slender questions Wagner can decide:
     Hath Mephistophilis no greater skill?
     Who knows not the double motion [77] of the planets?
     That the first is finish'd in a natural day;
     The second thus; Saturn in thirty years; Jupiter in twelve;
     Mars in four; the Sun, Venus, and Mercury in a year; the Moon
     in twenty-eight days.  These are freshmen's questions.  But
     tell me, hath every sphere a dominion or intelligentia?
