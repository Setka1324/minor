   QUEENE MOTHER. I, but my Lord, let me alone for that,
   For Katherine must have her will in France:
   As I doe live, so surely shall he dye,
   And Henry then shall weare the diadem.
   And if he grudge or crosse his Mothers will,
   Ile disinherite him and all the rest:
   For Ile rule France, but they shall weare the crowne:
   And if they storme, I then may pull them downe.
   Come my Lord let's goe.
