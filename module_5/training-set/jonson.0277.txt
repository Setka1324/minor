   ASP.  O, but to such whose faces are all zeal,
   And, with the words of Hercules, invade
   Such crimes as these!  that will not smell of sin,
   But seem as they were made of sanctity!
   Religion in their garments, and their hair
   Cut shorter than their eye-brows!  when the conscience
   Is vaster than the ocean, and devours
   More wretches than the counters.
