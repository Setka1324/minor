   ASP.  You trouble me -- and with a whip of steel,
   Print wounding lashes in their iron ribs.
   I fear no mood stamp'd in a private brow,
   When I am pleased t'unmask a public vice.
   I fear no strumpet's drugs, nor ruffian's stab,
   Should I detect their hateful luxuries:
   No broker's usurer's, or lawyer's gripe,
   Were I disposed to say, they are all corrupt.
   I fear no courtier's frown, should I applaud
   The easy flexure of his supple hams.
   Tut, these are so innate and popular,
   That drunken custom would not shame to laugh,
   In scorn, at him, that should but dare to tax 'em:
   And yet, not one of these, but knows his works,
   Knows what damnation is, the devil, and hell;
   Yet hourly they persist, grow rank in sin,
   Puffing their souls away in perjurous air,
   To cherish their extortion, pride, or lusts.
