LEATH. I pray you be content; you'll have enough on him, sir.
  _Now, gentles, I take it, here is none of you so stupid,
  But that you have heard of a little god of love call'd Cupid;
  Who out of kindness to Leander, hearing he but saw her,
  This present day and hour doth turn himself to a drawer.
  And because he would have their first meeting to be merry,
  He strikes Hero in love to him with a pint of sherry;
  Which he tells her from amorous Leander is sent her,
  Who after him into the room of Hero doth venture._
