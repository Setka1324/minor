_Kent._ My lords, of love to this our native land,
   I come to join with you, and leave the king;
   And in your quarrel, and the realm's behoof,
   Will be the first that shall adventure life.
_Lan._ I fear me, you are sent of policy,
   To undermine us with a show of love.
_War._ He is your brother; therefore have we cause
   To cast the worst, and doubt of your revolt.
_Kent._ Mine honour shall be hostage of my truth:
   If that will not suffice, farewell, my lords.
_Y. Mor._ Stay, Edmund: never was Plantagenet
   False of his word; and therefore trust we thee.
_Pem._ But what's the reason you should leave him now?
_Kent._ I have inform'd the Earl of Lancaster.
_Lan._ And it sufficeth.  Now, my lords, know this,
   That Gaveston is secretly arriv'd,
   And here in Tynmouth frolics with the king.
   Let us with these our followers scale the walls,
   And suddenly surprise them unawares.
_Y. Mor._ I'll give the onset.
_War._ And I'll follow thee.
_Y. Mor._ This tatter'd ensign of my ancestors,
   Which swept the desert shore of that Dead Sea
   Whereof we got the name of Mortimer,
   Will I advance upon this castle ['s] walls--
   Drums, strike alarum, raise them from their sport,
   And ring aloud the knell of Gaveston!
_Lan._ None be so hardy as to touch the king;
   But neither spare you Gaveston nor his friends.             [_Exeunt._
