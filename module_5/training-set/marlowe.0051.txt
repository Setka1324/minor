     CHORUS. Learned Faustus,
     To find the secrets of astronomy
     Graven in the book of Jove's high firmament,
     Did mount him [95] up to scale Olympus' top;
     Where, sitting in a chariot burning bright,
     Drawn by the strength of yoked dragons' necks,
     He views [96] the clouds, the planets, and the stars,
     The tropic zones, and quarters of the sky,
     From the bright circle of the horned moon
     Even to the height of Primum Mobile;
     And, whirling round with this [97] circumference,
     Within the concave compass of the pole,
     From east to west his dragons swiftly glide,
     And in eight days did bring him home again.
     Not long he stay'd within his quiet house,
     To rest his bones after his weary toil;
     But new exploits do hale him out again:
     And, mounted then upon a dragon's back,
     That with his wings did part the subtle air,
     He now is gone to prove cosmography,
     That measures coasts and kingdoms of the earth;
     And, as I guess, will first arrive at Rome,
     To see the Pope and manner of his court,
     And take some part of holy Peter's feast,
     The which this day is highly solemniz'd.
          [Exit.]
