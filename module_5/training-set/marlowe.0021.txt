     MEPHIST. Why, this is hell, nor am I out of it:
     Think'st thou that I, that saw the face of God,
     And tasted the eternal joys of heaven,
     Am not tormented with ten thousand hells,
     In being depriv'd of everlasting bliss?
     O, Faustus, leave these frivolous demands,
     Which strike [36] a terror to my fainting soul!
