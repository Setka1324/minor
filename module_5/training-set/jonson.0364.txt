   DELI.  Nay, Macilente, do not so discredit
   The goodness of your judgment to deny it.
   For I do speak the very least of her:
   And I would crave, and beg no more of Heaven,
   For all my fortunes here, but to be able
   To utter first in fit terms, what she is,
   And then the true joys I conceive in her.
