   GUISE. Trouble me not, I neare offended him,
   Nor will I aske forgivenes of the King.
   Oh that I have not power to stay my life,
   Nor immortalitie to be reveng'd:
   To dye by Pesantes, what a greefe is this?
   Ah Sextus, be reveng'd upon the King,
   Philip and Parma, I am slaine for you:
   Pope excommunicate, Philip depose,
   The wicked branch of curst Valois's line.
   Vive la messe, perish Hugonets,
   Thus Caesar did goe foorth, and thus he dies.
