  O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
  Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me![80]
  If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
  Abs√®nt thee from felicity awhile,
  And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
  To tell my story.--
  O, I die, Horatio;
  The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit;[81]
  The rest is silence.
