_Ã†n._ Yet flung I forth, and desperate of my life,
Ran in the thickest throngs, and with this sword
Sent many of their sauadge ghosts to hell.
At last came _Pirrhus_ fell and full of ire.
His harnesse dropping bloud, and on his speare
The mangled head of _Priams_ yongest sonne,
And after him his band of Mirmidons,
With balles of wilde fire in their murdering pawes,
Which made the funerall flame that burnt faire _Troy_:
All which hemd me about, crying, this is he.
