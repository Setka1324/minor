_Gan._ Might I but see that pretie sport a foote,
O how would I with _Helens_ brother laugh,
And bring the Gods to wonder at the game:
Sweet _Iupiter_, if ere I pleasde thine eye,
Or seemed faire walde in with Egles wings,
Grace my immortall beautie with this boone,
And I will spend my time in thy bright armes.
