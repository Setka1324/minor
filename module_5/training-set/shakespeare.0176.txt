    Hamlet probably begins these words in the ardour of confidence
    and sincerity; but suddenly alarmed at the magnitude of the
    disclosure he was going to make, and considering that, not his
    friend Horatio only, but another person was present, he breaks
    off suddenly:--"There's ne'er a villain in all Denmark that can
    match (perhaps he would have said) my uncle in villainy; but
    recollecting the danger of such a declaration, he pauses for a
    moment, and then abruptly concludes:--"but he's an arrant
    knave."]
