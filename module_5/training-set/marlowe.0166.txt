_Niece._ The grief for his exile was not so much
   As is the joy of his returning home.
   This letter came from my sweet Gaveston:
   What need'st thou, love, thus to excuse thyself?
   I know thou couldst not come and visit me.                   [_Reads._
   _I will not long be from thee, though I die;--_
   This argues the entire love of my lord;--                    [_Reads._
   _When I forsake thee, death seize on my heart!--_
   But stay thee here where Gaveston shall sleep.
                                       [_Puts the letter into her bosom._
   Now to the letter of my lord the king:
   He wills me to repair unto the court,
   And meet my Gaveston: why do I stay,
   Seeing that he talks thus of my marriage day?--
   Who's there?  Baldock!
   See that my coach be ready; I must hence.
_Bald._ It shall be done, madam.
_Niece._ And meet me at the park-pale presently          [_Exit Baldock._
   Spenser, stay you, and bear me company,
   For I have joyful news to tell thee of;
   My lord of Cornwall is a-coming over,
   And will be at the court as soon as we.
_Y. Spen._ I knew the king would have him home again.
_Niece._ If all things sort out, as I hope they will,
   Thy service, Spenser, shall be thought upon.
_Y. Spen._ I humbly thank your ladyship.
_Niece._ Come, lead the way: I long till I am there.           [_Exeunt._
