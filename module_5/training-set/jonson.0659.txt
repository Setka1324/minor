   CUT: Past imagination, sir, omnia secunda; you could not have
   pray'd to have had it so well. Saltat senex, as it is in the
   proverb; he does triumph in his felicity, admires the party! he
   has given me the lease of my house too! and I am now going for a
   silent minister to marry them, and away.
