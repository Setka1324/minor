   FAST.  Nay, you shall hear, sir:  with this we both fell out, and breath'd.
   Now, upon the second sign of his assault, I betook me to the former manner
   of my defence; he, on the other side, abandon'd his body to the same danger
   as before, and follows me still with blows:  but I being loth to take the
   deadly advantage that lay before me of his left side, made a kind of
   stramazoun, ran him up to the hilts through the doublet, through the shirt,
   and yet miss'd the skin.  He, making a reverse blow, -- falls upon my
   emboss'd girdle, I had thrown off the hangers a little before -- strikes
   off a skirt of a thick-laced satin doublet I had, lined with four taffatas,
   cuts off two panes embroidered with pearl, rends through the drawings-out
   of tissue, enters the linings, and skips the flesh.
