    [Footnote III.19: _No traveller returns_,] The traveller whom
    Hamlet had seen, though he appeared in the same habit which he
    had worn in his life-time, was nothing but a shadow,
    "invulnerable as the air," and, consequently, _incorporeal_. The
    Ghost has given us no account of the region from whence he came,
    being, as he himself informed us, "forbid to tell the secrets of
    his prison-house."--MALONE.]
