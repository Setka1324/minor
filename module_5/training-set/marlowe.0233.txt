   GUISE. If ever Hymen lowr'd at marriage rites,
   And had his alters decks with duskie lightes:
   If ever sunne stainde heaven with bloudy clowdes,
   And made it look with terrour on the worlde:
   If ever day were turnde to ugly night,
   And night made semblance of the hue of hell,
   This day, this houre, this fatall night,
   Shall fully shew the fury of them all.
   Apothecarie.--
