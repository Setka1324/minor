_Ã†n._ You sonnes of care, companions of my course,
_Priams_ misfortune followes vs by sea,
And _Helens_ rape doth haunt thee at the heeles.
How many dangers haue we ouer past?
Both barking _Scilla_, and the sounding Rocks,
The _Cyclops_ shelues, and grim _Ceranias_ seate
Haue you oregone, and yet remaine aliue!
Pluck vp your hearts, since fate still rests our friend,
And chaunging heauens may those good daies returne,
Which _Pergama_ did vaunt in all her pride.
