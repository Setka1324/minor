     FAUSTUS. [Stabbing his arm] Lo, Mephistophilis, for love of thee,
     Faustus hath cut his arm, and with his proper blood
     Assures his soul to be great Lucifer's,
     Chief lord and regent of perpetual night!
     View here this blood that trickles from mine arm,
     And let it be propitious for my [52] wish.
