   CLER: Why, sir, his mistress is married to-day to sir Dauphine's
   uncle, your cousin's neighbour, and he has diverted all the ladies,
   and all your company thither, to frustrate your provision, and stick
   a disgrace upon you. He was here now to have enticed us away from
   you too: but we told him his own, I think.
