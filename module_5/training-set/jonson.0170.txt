KNOCK. I conceive thee, Urse: go thy ways. [_Exit Ursula._]--Dost thou
hear, Whit? is't not pity, my delicate dark chestnut here, with the
fine lean head, large forehead, round eyes, even mouth, sharp ears,
long neck, thin crest, close withers, plain back, deep sides, short
fillets, and full flanks; with a round belly, a plump buttock, large
thighs, knit knees, strait legs, short pasterns, smooth hoofs, and
short heels, should lead a dull honest woman's life, that might live
the life of a lady?
