     MEPHIST. Marriage is but a ceremonial toy,
     And, if thou lov'st me, think no more of it.
     I'll cull thee out the fairest courtezans,
     And bring them every morning to thy bed:
     She whom thine [65] eye shall like, thy [66] heart shall have,
     Were she as chaste as was [67] Penelope,
     As wise as Saba, or as beautiful
     As was bright Lucifer before his fall.
     Here, take this book, peruse it well:
     The iterating of these lines brings gold;
     The framing of this circle on the ground
     Brings thunder, whirlwinds, storm, and lightning;
     Pronounce this thrice devoutly to thyself,
     And men in harness [68] shall appear to thee,
     Ready to execute what thou command'st.
