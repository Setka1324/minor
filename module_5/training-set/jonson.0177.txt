QUAR. Keep it for your companions in beastliness, I am none of them,
sir. If I had not already forgiven you a greater trespass, or thought
you yet worth my beating, I would instruct your manners, to whom you
made your offers. But go your ways, talk not to me, the hangman is
only fit to discourse with you; the hand of beadle is too merciful a
punishment for your trade of life. [_Exit Edgworth._]--I am sorry I
employ'd this fellow, for he thinks me such; _facinus quos inquinat,
Ã¦quat._ But it was for sport; and would I make it serious, the getting
of this license is nothing to me, without other circumstances concur.
I do think how impertinently I labour, if the word be not mine that
the ragged fellow mark'd: and what advantage I have given Ned Winwife
in this time now of working her, though it be mine. He'll go near to
form to her what a debauched rascal I am, and fright her out of all
good conceit of me: I should do so by him, I am sure, if I had the
opportunity. But my hope is in her temper yet; and it must needs be
next to despair, that is grounded on any part of a woman's discretion.
I would give, by my troth now, all I could spare, to my clothes and my
sword, to meet my tatter'd soothsayer again, who was my judge in the
question, to know certainly whose word he has damn'd or saved; for
till then I live but under a reprieve. I must seek him. Who be these?
