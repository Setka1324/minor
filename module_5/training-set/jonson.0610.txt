   CLER: A pox of her autumnal face, her pieced beauty! there's no man
   can be admitted till she be ready, now-a-days, till she has
   painted, and perfumed, and wash'd, and scour'd, but the boy here;
   and him she wipes her oil'd lips upon, like a sponge. I have made
   a song, I pray thee hear it, on the subject.
