     BENVOLIO. Well, go you attend the Emperor.  I am content, for
     this once, to thrust my head out at a [150] window; for they
     say, if a man be drunk over night, the devil cannot hurt him
     in the morning:  if that be true, I have a charm in my head,
     shall control him as well as the conjurer, I warrant you.
          [Exeunt FREDERICK and MARTINO.]
