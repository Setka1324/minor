  _Pol._ My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
  Behind the arras I'll convey myself,[109]
  To hear the process;[110] I'll warrant, she'll tax him home:
  And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
  'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
  Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
  The speech of vantage.[111] Fare you well, my liege:
