   COR.  You say well, but I would fain hear one of these autumn-judgments
   define once, "Quid sit comoedia?" if he cannot, let him content himself
   with Cicero's definition, till he have strength to propose to himself a
   better, who would have a comedy to be 'imitatio vitae, speculum
   consuetudinis, imago veritatis'; a thing throughout pleasant and
   ridiculous, and accommodated to the correction of manners:  if the maker
   have fail'd in any particle of this, they may worthily tax him; but if not,
   why -- be you, that are for them, silent, as I will be for him; and give
   way to the actors.
