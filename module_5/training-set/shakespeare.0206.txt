    [Footnote II.26: _You are a fishmonger._] This was an expression
    better understood in Shakespeare's time than at present, and no
    doubt was relished by the audience of the Globe Theatre as
    applicable to the Papists, who in Queen Elizabeth's time were
    esteemed enemies to the Government. Hence the proverbial phrase
    of _He's an honest man and eats no fish_; to signify he's a
    friend to the Government and a Protestant.]
