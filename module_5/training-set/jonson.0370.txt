   FAL.  Ay!  have they so?
   In your gross judgment.  If you make no difference
   Betwixt the scent of growing flowers and cut ones,
   You have a sense to taste lamp oil, i'faith:
   And with such judgment have you changed the chambers,
   Leaving no room, that I can joy to be in,
   In all your house; and now my walk, and all,
   You smoke me from, as if I were a fox,
   And long, belike, to drive me quite away:
   Well, walk you there, and I'll walk where I list.
