     VALDES. Faustus, these books, thy wit, and our experience,
     Shall make all nations to [18] canonize us.
     As Indian Moors obey their Spanish lords,
     So shall the spirits of every element
     Be always serviceable to us three;
     Like lions shall they guard us when we please;
     Like Almain rutters with their horsemen's staves,
     Or Lapland giants, trotting by our sides;
     Sometimes like women, or unwedded maids,
     Shadowing more beauty in their airy brows
     Than have [19] the white breasts of the queen of love:
     From Venice shall they [20] drag huge [21] argosies,
     And from America the golden fleece
     That yearly stuffs [22] old Philip's treasury;
     If learned Faustus will be resolute.
