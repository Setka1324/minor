     CURSED BE HE THAT STOLE HIS HOLINESS' MEAT FROM THE TABLE!
     maledicat Dominus!
     CURSED BE HE THAT STRUCK [136] HIS HOLINESS A BLOW ON [137] THE
     FACE!  maledicat Dominus!
     CURSED BE HE THAT STRUCK FRIAR SANDELO A BLOW ON THE PATE!
     maledicat Dominus!
     CURSED BE HE THAT DISTURBETH OUR HOLY DIRGE!  maledicat
     Dominus!
     CURSED BE HE THAT TOOK AWAY HIS HOLINESS' WINE!  maledicat
     Dominus!
