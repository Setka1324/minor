    [Footnote III.54: _Speak no more them is set down for them:_]
    Shakespeare alludes to a custom of his time, when the clown, or
    low comedian, as he would now be called, addressing the audience
    during the play, entered into a contest of raillery and sarcasm
    with such spectators as chose to engage with him.]
