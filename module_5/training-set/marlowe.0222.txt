_First Lord._ My lord, here is the head of Mortimer.
_K. Edw. Third._ Go fetch my father's hearse, where it shall lie;
   And bring my funeral robes.                      [_Exeunt Attendants._
                                Accursed head,
   Could I have rul'd thee then, as I do now,
   Thou hadst not hatch'd this monstrous treachery!--
   Here comes the hearse: help me to mourn, my lords.
