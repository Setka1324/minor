_K. Edw._ My Gaveston!
   Welcome to Tynmouth! welcome to thy friend!
   Thy absence made me droop and pine away;
   For, as the lovers of fair DanaÃ«,
   When she was lock'd up in a brazen tower,
   Desir'd her more, and wax'd outrageous,
   So did it fare with me: and now thy sight
   Is sweeter far than was thy parting hence
   Bitter and irksome to my sobbing heart.
_Gav._ Sweet lord and king, your speech preventeth mine;
   Yet have I words left to express my joy:
   The shepherd, nipt with biting winter's rage,
   Frolics not more to see the painted spring
   Than I do to behold your majesty.
_K. Edw._ Will none of you salute my Gaveston?
_Lan._ Salute him! yes.--Welcome, Lord Chamberlain!
_Y. Mor._ Welcome is the good Earl of Cornwall!
_War._ Welcome, Lord Governor of the Isle of Man!
_Pem._ Welcome, Master Secretary!
_Kent._ Brother, do you hear them?
_K. Edw._ Still will these earls and barons use me thus?
_Gav._ My lord, I cannot brook these injuries.
_Q. Isab._ Ay me, poor soul, when these begin to jar!           [_Aside._
_K. Edw._ Return it to their throats; I'll be thy warrant.
_Gav._ Base, leaden earls, that glory in your birth,
   Go sit at home, and eat your tenants' beef;
   And come not here to scoff at Gaveston,
   Whose mounting thoughts did never creep so low
   As to bestow a look on such as you.
_Lan._ Yet I disdain not to do this for you.
                         [_Draws his sword, and offers to stab Gaveston._
_K. Edw._ Treason! treason! where's the traitor?
_Pem._ Here, here!
_K. Edw._ Convey hence Gaveston; they'll murder him.
_Gav._ The life of thee shall salve this foul disgrace.
_Y. Mor._ Villain, thy life! unless I miss mine aim.  [_Wounds Gaveston._
_Q. Isab._ Ah, furious Mortimer, what hast thou done.
_Y. Mor._ No more than I would answer, were he slain.
                                        [_Exit Gaveston with Attendants._
_K. Edw._ Yes, more than thou canst answer, though he live:
   Dear shall you both abide this riotous deed:
   Out of my presence! come not near the court.
_Y. Mor._ I'll not be barr'd the court for Gaveston.
_Lan._ We'll hale him by the ears unto the block.
_K. Edw._ Look to your own heads; his is sure enough.
_War._ Look to your own crown, if you back him thus.
_Kent._ Warwick, these words do ill beseem thy years.
_K. Edw._ Nay, all of them conspire to cross me thus:
   But, if I live, I'll tread upon their heads
   That think with high looks thus to tread me down.
   Come, Edmund, let's away, and levy men:
   'Tis war that must abate these barons' pride.
                         [_Exeunt King Edward, Queen Isabella, and Kent._
_War._ Let's to our castles, for the king is mov'd.
_Y. Mor._ Mov'd may he be, and perish in his wrath!
_Lan._ Cousin, it is no dealing with him now;
   He means to make us stoop by force of arms:
   And therefore let us jointly here protest
   To prosecute that Gaveston to the death.
_Y. Mor._ By heaven, the abject villain shall not live!
_War._ I'll have his blood, or die in seeking it.
_Pem._ The like oath Pembroke takes.
_Lan._ And so doth Lancaster.
   Now send our heralds to defy the king;
   And make the people swear to put him down.
