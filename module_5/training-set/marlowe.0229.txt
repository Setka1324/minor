   NAVARRE. Prince Condy and my good Lord Admiral,
   Now Guise may storme but does us little hurt:
   Having the King, Queene Mother on our side,
   To stop the mallice of his envious heart,
   That seekes to murder all the Protestants:
   Have you not heard of late how he decreed,
   If that the King had given consent thereto,
   That all the protestants that are in Paris,
   Should have been murdered the other night?
