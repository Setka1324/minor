BUSY. The master of the rebels' hand thou hast. Satan's! hold thy
peace, thy scurrility, shut up thy mouth, thy profession is damnable,
and in pleading for it thou dost plead for Baal. I have long opened my
mouth wide, and gaped; I have gaped as the oyster for the tide, after
thy destruction: but cannot compass it by suit or dispute; so that I
look for a bickering, ere long, and then a battle.
