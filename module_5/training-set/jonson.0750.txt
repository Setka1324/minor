   CLER: A riddle! pray let me see it.
   [READS.]
   Sir Dauphine, I chose this way of intimation for privacy. The
   ladies here, I know, have both hope and purpose to make a
   collegiate and servant of you. If I might be so honoured, as to
   appear at any end of so noble a work, I would enter into a fame
   of taking physic to-morrow, and continue it four or five days,
   or longer, for your visitation. Mavis.
   By my faith, a subtle one! Call you this a riddle? what's their
   plain dealing, trow?
