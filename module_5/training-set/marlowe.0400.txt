_Ã†n._ How should I put into the raging deepe,
Who haue no sailes nor tackling for my ships?
What would the Gods haue me _Deucalion_ like,
Flote vp and downe where ere the billowes driue?
Though she repairde my fleete and gaue me ships,
Yet hath she tane away my oares and masts,
And left me neither saile nor sterne abourd.
