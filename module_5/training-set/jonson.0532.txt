   MACI.  'Tis true, sir, committed for the stir here to-night.  Now would I
   have you send your brother home afore him, with the report of this your
   kindness done him, to his sister, which will so pleasingly possess her, and
   out of his mouth too, that in the meantime you may clap your action on
   Brisk, and your wife, being in so happy a mood, cannot entertain it ill, by
   any means.
