   TRUE: Yes faith; if thou shouldst hope otherwise, I should repent me:
   this horn got me entrance; kiss it. I had no other way to get in,
   but by faining to be a post; but when I got in once, I proved none,
   but rather the contrary, turn'd him into a post, or a stone, or
   what is stiffer, with thundering into him the incommodities of a
   wife, and the miseries of marriage. If ever Gorgon were seen in
   the shape of a woman, he hath seen her in my description: I have
   put him off o' that scent for ever.--Why do you not applaud and
   adore me, sirs? why stand you mute? are you stupid? You are not
   worthy of the benefit.
