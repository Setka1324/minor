SHIFT, a thread-bare shark; one that never was a soldier, yet lives upon
lendings.  His profession is skeldring and odling, his bank Paul's, and his
warehouse Picthatch.  Takes up single testons upon oaths, till doomsday.
Falls under executions of three shillings, and enters into five-groat
bonds.  He way-lays the reports of services, and cons them without book,
damning himself he came new from them, when all the while he was taking the
diet in the bawdy-house, or lay pawned in his chamber for rent and
victuals.  He is of that admirable and happy memory, that he will salute
one for an old acquaintance that he never saw in his life before.  He
usurps upon cheats, quarrels, and robberies, which he never did, only to
get him a name.  His chief exercises are, taking the whiff, squiring a
cockatrice, and making privy searches for imparters.
