   SORD.  "The 20, 21, 22 days, rain and wind."  O good, good!  "the 23, and
   24, rain and some wind," good!  "the 25, rain," good still!  "26, 27, 28,
   wind and some rain"; would it had been rain and some wind!  well, 'tis
   good, when it can be no better.  "29, inclining to rain":  inclining to
   rain!  that's not so good now:  "30, and 31, wind and no rain":  no rain!
   'slid, stay:  this is worse and worse:  What says he of St. Swithin's?
   turn back, look, "saint Swithin's:  no rain!"
