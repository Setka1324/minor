   CHARLES. O no, my loving brother of Navarre.
   I have deserv'd a scourge I must confesse,
   Yet is there pacience of another sort,
   Then to misdoe the welfare of their King:
   God graunt my neerest freends may prove no worse.
   O horde me up, my sight begins to faire,
   My sinnewes shrinke, my brain turns upside downe,
   My heart doth break, I faint and dye.
