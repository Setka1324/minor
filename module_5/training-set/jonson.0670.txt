   CLER: Yes, for look you, sir, this was the injury to you. La-Foole
   intended this feast to honour her bridal day, and made you the
   property to invite the college ladies, and promise to bring her:
   and then at the time she should have appear'd, as his friend, to
   have given you the dor. Whereas now, Sir Dauphine has brought her
   to a feeling of it, with this kind of satisfaction, that you shall
   bring all the ladies to the place where she is, and be very
   jovial; and there, she will have a dinner, which shall be in your
   name: and so disappoint La-Foole, to make you good again, and, as
   it were, a saver in the main.
