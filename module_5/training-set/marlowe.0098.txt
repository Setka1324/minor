     FAUSTUS. What's here? an ambush to betray my life!
     Then, Faustus, try thy skill.--Base peasants, stand!
     For, lo, these [193] trees remove at my command,
     And stand as bulwarks 'twixt yourselves and me,
     To shield me from your hated treachery!
     Yet, to encounter this your weak attempt,
     Behold, an army comes incontinent!
