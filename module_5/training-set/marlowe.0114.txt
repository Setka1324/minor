     FIRST SCHOLAR. Master Doctor Faustus, since our conference
     about fair ladies, which was the beautifulest in all the world,
     we have determined with ourselves that Helen of Greece was the
     admirablest lady that ever lived:  therefore, Master Doctor, if
     you will do us so much favour as to let us see that peerless
     dame of Greece, whom all the world admires for majesty, we should
     think ourselves much beholding unto you.
