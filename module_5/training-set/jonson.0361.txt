   MACI.  I thank you, sir. --
   And yet the muffled Fates, had it pleased them,
   Might have supplied me from their own full store.
   Without this word, 'I thank you', to a fool.
   I see no reason why that dog call'd Chance,
   Should fawn upon this fellow more than me;
   I am a man, and I have limbs, flesh, blood,
   Bones, sinews, and a soul, as well as he:
   My parts are every way as good as his;
   If I said better, why, I did not lie.
   Nath'less, his wealth, but nodding on my wants,
   Must make me bow, and cry, 'I thank you, sir'.
   [ASIDE.
