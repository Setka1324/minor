LEATH. _This tragical encounter falling out thus to busy us,
  It raises up the ghost of their friend Dionysius;
  Not like a monarch, but the master of a school,
  In a scrivener's furr'd gown, which shews he is no fool:
  For therein he hath wit enough to keep himself warm.
  O Damon, he cries, and Pythias, what harm
  Hath poor Dionysius done you in his grave,
  That after his death you should fall out thus and rave,
  And call amorous Leander whore-master knave?_
