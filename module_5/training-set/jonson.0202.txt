LEATH. _Gentles, that no longer your expectations may wander,
  Behold our chief actor, amorous Leander.
  With a great deal of cloth, lapp'd about him like a scarf,
  For he yet serves his father, a dyer at Puddle-wharf;
  Which place we'll make bold with, to call it our Abydus,
  As the Bank-side is our Sestos; and let it not be deny'd us.
  Now as he is beating to make the dye take the fuller,
  Who chances to come by, but fair Hero in a sculler;
  And seeing Leander's naked leg and goodly calf,
  Cast at him from the boat a sheep's eye and an half.
  Now she is landed, and the sculler come back,
  By and by you shall see what Leander doth lack._
