   TRUE: A man should not doubt to overcome any woman. Think he can
   vanquish them, and he shall: for though they deny, their desire
   is to be tempted. Penelope herself cannot hold out long. Ostend,
   you saw, was taken at last. You must persever, and hold to your
   purpose. They would solicit us, but that they are afraid.
   Howsoever, they wish in their hearts we should solicit them.
   Praise them, flatter them, you shall never want eloquence or
   trust: even the chastest delight to feel themselves that way
   rubb'd. With praises you must mix kisses too: if they take them,
   they'll take more--though they strive, they would be overcome.
