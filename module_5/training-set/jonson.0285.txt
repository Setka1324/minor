   ASP.  Peace, Mitis, I do know your thought;
   You'll say, your guests here will except at this:
   Pish!  you are too timorous, and full of doubt.
   Then he, a patient, shall reject all physic,
   'Cause the physician tells him, you are sick:
   Or, if I say, that he is vicious,
   You will not hear of virtue.  Come, you are fond.
   Shall I be so extravagant, to think,
   That happy judgments, and composed spirits,
   Will challenge me for taxing such as these?
   I am ashamed.
