     SECOND SCHOLAR. Well, gentlemen, though Faustus' end be such
     As every Christian heart laments to think on,
     Yet, for he was a scholar once admir'd
     For wondrous knowledge in our German schools,
     We'll give his mangled limbs due burial;
     And all the students, cloth'd in mourning black,
     Shall wait upon his heavy funeral.
          [Exeunt.]
