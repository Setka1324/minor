_Mes._ From Scotland, my lord.             [_Giving letters to Mortimer._
_Lan._ Why, how now, cousin! how fare all our friends?
_Y. Mor._ My uncle's taken prisoner by the Scots.
_Lan._ We'll have him ransom'd, man: be of good cheer.
_Y. Mor._ They rate his ransom at five thousand pound.
   Who should defray the money but the king,
   Seeing he is taken prisoner in his wars?
   I'll to the king.
_Lan._ Do, cousin, and I'll bear thee company.
_War._ Meantime my Lord of Pembroke and myself
   Will to Newcastle here, and gather head.
_Y. Mor._ About it, then, and we will follow you.
_Lan._ Be resolute and full of secrecy.
_War._ I warrant you.                              [_Exit with Pembroke._
_Y. Mor._ Cousin, an if he will not ransom him,
   I'll thunder such a peal into his ears
   As never subject did unto his king.
_Lan._ Content; I'll bear my part.--Hollo! who's there?
