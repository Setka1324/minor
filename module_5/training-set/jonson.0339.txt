   [LADY PUNTARVOLO APPEARS AT THE WINDOW.
   PUNT.  What more than heavenly pulchritude is this.
   What magazine, or treasury of bliss?
   Dazzle, you organs to my optic sense,
   To view a creature of such eminence:
   O, I am planet-struck, and in yon sphere
   A brighter star than Venus doth appear!
