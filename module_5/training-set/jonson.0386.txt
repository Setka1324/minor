   COR.  No more, assure you, will any grave, wise citizen, or modest matron,
   take the object of this folly in Deliro and his wife; but rather apply it
   as the foil to their own virtues.  For that were to affirm, that a man
   writing of Nero, should mean all emperors; or speaking of Machiavel,
   comprehend all statesmen; or in our Sordido, all farmers; and so of the
   rest:  than which nothing can be uttered more malicious or absurd.  Indeed
   there are a sort of these narrow-eyed decypherers, I confess, that will
   extort strange and abstruse meanings out of any subject, be it never so
   conspicuous and innocently delivered.  But to such, where'er they sit
   concealed, let them know, the author defies them and their writing-tables;
   and hopes no sound or safe judgment will infect itself with their
   contagious comments, who, indeed, come here only to pervert and poison the
   sense of what they hear, and for nought else.
