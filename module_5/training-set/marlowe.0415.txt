_Dido._ I, I, _Iarbus_, after this is done,
None in the world shall have my loue but thou:
So, leaue me now, let none approach this place. _Exit Iarbus._
Now _Dido_, with these reliques burne thy selfe,
And make _Æneas_ famous through the world,
For periurie and slaughter of a Queene:
Here lye the Sword that in the darksome Caue
He drew, and swore by to be true to me,
Thou shalt burne first, thy crime is worse then his:
Here lye the garment which I cloath'd him in,
When first he came on shoare, perish thou to:
These letters, lines, and periurd papers all,
Shall burne to cinders in this prectious flame.
And now ye Gods that guide the starrie frame,
And order all things at your high dispose;
Graunt, though the traytors land in _Italy_,
They may be still tormented with vnrest,
And from mine ashes let a Conquerour rise,
That may reuenge this treason to a Queene,
By plowing vp his Countries with the Sword:
Betwixt this land and that be neuer league,
_Littora littoribus contraria, fluctibus undas
Impresor: arma armis: pugnent ipsig nepotes_:
Liue false _Æneas_, truest _Dido_ dyes,
_Sic sic inuat ire sub umbras_.
