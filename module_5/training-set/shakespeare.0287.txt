    [Footnote III.119: _Takes off the rose From the fair forehead of
    an innocent love, And sets a blister there_;] _i.e._, takes the
    clear tint from the brow of unspotted, untainted innocence. "True
    or honest as the skin between one's brows" was a proverbial
    expression, and is frequently used by Shakespeare.]
