   SORD.  Ay, their exclaims
   Move me as much, as thy breath moves a mountain.
   Poor worms, they hiss at me, whilst I at home
   Can be contented to applaud myself,
   To sit and clap my hands, and laugh, and leap,
   Knocking my head against my roof, with joy
   To see how plump my bags are, and my barns.
   Sirrah, go hie you home, and bid your fellows
   Get all their flails ready again I come.
