   PUNT.  Pray, sir, give me leave to report him.  He's a gentleman, lady, of
   that rare and admirable faculty, as, I protest, I know not his like in
   Europe; he is exceedingly valiant, an excellent scholar, and so exactly
   travelled, that he is able, in discourse, to deliver you a model of any
   prince's court in the world; speaks the languages with that purity of
   phrase, and facility of accent, that it breeds astonishment; his wit, the
   most exuberant, and, above wonder, pleasant, of all that ever entered the
   concave of this ear.
