   TRUE: S'lid, I would be the author of more to vex him; that purpose
   deserves it: it gives thee law of plaguing him. I will tell thee
   what I would do. I would make a false almanack; get it printed:
   and then have him drawn out on a coronation day to the Tower-wharf,
   and kill him with the noise of the ordnance. Disinherit thee! he
   cannot, man. Art not thou next of blood, and his sister's son?
