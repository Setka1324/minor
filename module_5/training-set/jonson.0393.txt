   "If this city, or the suburbs of the same, do afford any young gentleman of
   the first, second, or third head, more or less, whose friends are but
   lately deceased, and whose lands are but new come into his hands, that, to
   be as exactly qualified as the best of our ordinary gallants are, is
   affected to entertain the most gentleman-like use of tobacco; as first, to
   give it the most exquisite perfume; then, to know all the delicate sweet
   forms for the assumption of it; as also the rare corollary and practice of
   the Cuban ebolition, euripus and whiff, which he shall receive or take in
   here at London, and evaporate at Uxbridge, or farther, if it please him.
   If there be any such generous spirit, that is truly enamoured of these good
   faculties; may it please him, but by a note of his hand to specify the
   place or ordinary where he uses to eat and lie; and most sweet attendance,
   with tobacco and pipes of the best sort, shall be ministered.  'Stet,
   quaeso, candide Lector.'"
