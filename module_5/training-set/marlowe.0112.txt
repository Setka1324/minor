     FAUSTUS. Please it your grace, the year is divided into two
     circles over the whole world; so that, when it is winter with
     us, in the contrary circle it is likewise summer with them, as
     in India, Saba, and such countries that lie far east, where
     they have fruit twice a-year; from whence, by means of a swift
     spirit that I have, I had these grapes brought, as you see.
