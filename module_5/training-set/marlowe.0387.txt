_Dido._ O keepe them still, and let me gaze my fill:
Now lookes _Æneas_ like immortall _Ioue_,
O where is _Ganimed_ to hold his cup,
And _Mercury_ to flye for what he calles,
Ten thousand _Cupids_ houer in the ayre,
And fanne it in _Æneas_ louely face,
O that the Clowdes were here wherein thou fleest,
That thou and I vnseene might sport our selues:
Heauens enuious of our ioyes is waxen pale,
And when we whisper, then the starres fall downe,
To be partakers of our honey talke.
