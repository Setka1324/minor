_Dido._ What more then delian musicke doe I heare,
That calles my soule from forth his liuing seate,
To moue vnto the measures of delight:
Kind clowdes that sent forth such a curteous storme,
As made disdaine to flye to fancies lap:
Stoute loue in mine armes make thy _Italy_,
Whose Crowne and kingdome rests at thy commande.
_Sicheus_, not _Ã†neas_ be thou calde:
The King of _Carthage_, not _Anchises_ sonne:
Hold, take these Iewels at thy Louers hand,
These golden bracelets, and this wedding ring,
Wherewith my husband woo'd me yet a maide,
And be thou king of _Libia_, by my guift.
