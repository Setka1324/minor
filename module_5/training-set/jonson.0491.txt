   COR.  To help your longing, signior, let your imagination be swifter than a
   pair of oars:  and by this, suppose Puntarvolo, Brisk, Fungoso, and the
   dog, arrived at the court-gate, and going up to the great chamber.
   Macilente and Sogliardo, we'll leave them on the water, till possibility
   and natural means may land them.  Here come the gallants, now prepare your
   expectations.
