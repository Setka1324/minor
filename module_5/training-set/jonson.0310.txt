   CAR.  Both, both; a lean mongrel, he looks as if he were chop-fallen, with
   barking at other men's good fortunes:  'ware how you offend him; he carries
   oil and fire in his pen, will scald where it drops:  his spirit is like
   powder, quick, violent; he'll blow a man up with a jest:  I fear him worse
   than a rotten wall does the cannon; shake an hour after at the report.
   Away, come not near him.
