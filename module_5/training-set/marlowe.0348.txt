_Dido._ No, for thy sake Ile loue thy father well.
O dull conceipted _Dido_, that till now
Didst neuer thinke _Æneas_ beautifull:
But now for quittance of this ouersight,
Ile make me bracelets of his golden haire,
His glistering eyes shall be my looking glasse,
His lips an altar, where Ile offer vp
As many kisses as the Sea hath sands,
In stead of musicke I will heare him speake,
His lookes shall be my only Librarie,
And thou _Æneas, Didos_ treasurie,
In whose faire bosome I will locke more wealth,
Then twentie thousand Indiaes can affoord:
O here he comes, loue, loue, giue _Dido_ leaue
To be more modest then her thoughts admit,
Lest I be made a wonder to the world.
_Achates_, how doth _Carthage_ please your Lord?
