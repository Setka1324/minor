   Cardinall  Madam, as I in secresy was tolde,
   My brother Guise hath gathered a power of men,
   Which are he saith, to kill the Puritans,
   But tis the house of Burbon that he meanest
   Now Madam must you insinuate with the King,
   And tell him that tis for his Countries good,
   And common profit of Religion.
