_Æn._ _Carthage_, my friendly host adue,
Since destinie doth call me from the shoare:
_Hermes_ this night descending in a dreame,
Hath summond me to fruitfull _Italy_:
_Ioue_ wils it so, my mother wils it so:
Let my Phenissa graunt, and then I goe:
Graunt she or no, _Æneas_ must away,
Whose golden fortunes clogd with courtly ease,
Cannot ascend to Fames immortall house,
Or banquet in bright honors burnisht hall,
Till he hath furrowed _Neptunes_ glassie fieldes,
And cut a passage through his toples hilles:
_Achates_ come forth, _Sergestus_, _Illioneus_,
_Cloanthus_, haste away, _Æneas_ calles.
