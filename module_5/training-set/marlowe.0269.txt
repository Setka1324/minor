   GUISE. Thou trothles and unjust, what lines are these?
   Am I growne olde, or is thy lust growne yong,
   Or hath my love been so obscurde in thee,
   That others need to comment on my text?
   Is all my love forgot which helde thee deare?
   I, dearer then the apple of mine eye?
   Is Guises glory but a clowdy mist,
   In sight and judgement of thy lustfull eye?
   Mor du, were not the fruit within thy wombe,
   On whose encrease I set some longing hope:
   This wrathfull hand should strike thee to the hart
   Hence strumpet, hide thy head for shame,
   And fly my presence if thou look'st to live.
