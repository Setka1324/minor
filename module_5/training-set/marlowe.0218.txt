_K. Edw._ I am too weak and feeble to resist.--
   Assist me, sweet God, and receive my soul!
_Light._ Run for the table.
_K. Edw._ O, spare me, or despatch me in a trice!
                   [_Matrevis brings in a table.  King Edward is murdered
                       by holding him down on the bed with the table, and
                       stamping on it._
_Light._ So, lay the table down, and stamp on it,
   But not too hard, lest that you bruise his body.
_Mat._ I fear me that this cry will raise the town,
   And therefore let us take horse and away.
_Light._ Tell me, sirs, was it not bravely done?
_Gur._ Excellent well: take this for thy reward.
                                            [_Stabs Lightborn, who dies._
   Come, let us cast the body in the moat,
   And bear the king's to Mortimer our lord:
   Away!                                       [_Exeunt with the bodies._
