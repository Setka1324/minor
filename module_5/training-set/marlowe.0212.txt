_Y. Mor._ The king must die, or Mortimer goes down;
   The commons now begin to pity him:
   Yet he that is the cause of Edward's death,
   Is sure to pay for it when his son's of age;
   And therefore will I do it cunningly.
   This letter, written by a friend of ours,
   Contains his death, yet bids then save his life;
                                                                [_Reads._
   _Edwardum occidere nolite timere, bonum est,
   Fear not to kill the king, 'tis good he die:_
   But read it thus, and that's another sense;
   _Edwardum occidere nolite, timere bonum est,
   Kill not the king, 'tis good to fear the worst._
   Unpointed as it is, thus shall it go.
   That, being dead, if it chance to be found,
   Matrevis and the rest may bear the blame,
   And we be quit that caus'd it to be done.
   Within this room is lock'd the messenger
   That shall convey it, and perform the rest;
   And, by a secret token that he bears,
   Shall he be murder'd when the deed is done.--
   Lightborn, come forth!
