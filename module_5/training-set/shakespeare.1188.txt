Yes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon
the children, therefore, I promise you, I fear you. I was always plain
with you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter. Therefore be
of good cheer, for truly I think you are damnâ€™d. There is but one hope
in it that can do you any good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope
neither.
