   MACI.  Why say, that they should shew the frothy fool
   Such grace as they pretend comes from the heart,
   He had a mighty windfall out of doubt!
   Why, all their graces are not to do grace
   To virtue or desert; but to ride both
   With their gilt spurs quite breathless, from themselves.
   'Tis now esteem'd precisianism in wit,
   And a disease in nature, to be kind
   Toward desert, to love or seek good names.
   Who feeds with a good name?  who thrives with loving?
   Who can provide feast for his own desires,
   With serving others? -- ha, ha, ha!
   'Tis folly, by our wisest worldlings proved,
   If not to gain by love, to be beloved.
