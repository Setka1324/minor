   DELI.  Ay, and she knows so well
   Her own deserts, that, when I strive t'enjoy them,
   She weighs the things I do, with what she merits;
   And, seeing my worth out-weigh'd so in her graces,
   She is so solemn, so precise, so froward,
   That no observance I can do to her
   Can make her kind to me:  if she find fault,
   I mend that fault; and then she says, I faulted,
   That I did mend it.  Now, good friend, advise me,
   How I may temper this strange spleen in her.
