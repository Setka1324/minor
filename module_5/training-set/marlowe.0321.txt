_Ã†n._ Hold, take this candle and goe light a fire,
You shall haue leaues and windfall bowes enow
Neere to these woods, to rost your meate withall:
_Ascanius_, goe and drie thy drenched lims,
Whiles I with my _Achates_ roaue abroad,
To know what coast the winde hath driuen vs on,
Or whether men or beasts inhabite it.
