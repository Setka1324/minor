  _Ham._ And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.[122]
  There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
  Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
  But come;--
  Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
  How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
  As I, perchance, hereafter shall think meet
  To put an antick disposition[123] on,--
  That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
  With arms encumber'd thus,[124] or this head-shake,
  Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
  As, _Well, we know_; or, _We could, an if we would_; or, _If
  we list to speak_;--or, _There be, an if they might_;--
  Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
  That you know aught of me:--This do you swear,
  So grace and mercy at your most need help you!
