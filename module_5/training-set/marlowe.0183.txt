_K. Edw._ Madam, what news?
_Q. Isab._ News of dishonour, lord, and discontent.
   Our friend Levune, faithful and full of trust,
   Informeth us, by letters and by words,
   That Lord Valois our brother, King of France,
   Because your highness hath been slack in homage,
   Hath seized Normandy into his hands:
   These be the letters, this the messenger.
_K. Edw._ Welcome, Levune.--Tush, Sib, if this be all,
   Valois and I will soon be friends again.--
   But to my Gaveston: shall I never see,
   Never behold thee now!--Madam, in this matter
   We will employ you and your little son;
   You shall go parley with the King of France.--
   Boy, see you bear you bravely to the king,
   And do your message with a majesty.
_P. Edw._ Commit not to my youth things of more weight
   Than fits a prince so young as I to bear;
   And fear not, lord and father,--heaven's great beams
   On Atlas' shoulder shall not lie more safe
   Than shall your charge committed to my trust.
_Q. Isab._ Ah, boy, this towardness makes thy mother fear
   Thou art not mark'd to many days on earth!
_K. Edw._ Madam, we will that you with speed be shipp'd,
   And this our son; Levune shall follow you
   With all the haste we can despatch him hence.
   Choose of our lords to bear you company;
   And go in peace; leave us in wars at home.
_Q. Isab._ Unnatural wars, where subjects brave their king:
   God end them once!--My lord, I take my leave,
   To make my preparation for France.         [_Exit with Prince Edward._
