     FAUSTUS. But Faustus' offence can ne'er be pardoned:  the serpent
     that tempted Eve may be saved, but not Faustus.  O gentlemen,
     hear me [248] with patience, and tremble not at my speeches!  Though
     my heart pant and quiver to remember that I have been a student
     here these thirty years, O, would I had never [249] seen Wittenberg,
     never read book! and what wonders I have done, all Germany can
     witness, yea, all the world; for which Faustus hath lost both
     Germany and the world, yea, heaven itself, heaven, the seat of
     God, the throne of the blessed, the kingdom of joy; and must
     remain in hell for ever, hell.  O, hell, for ever!  Sweet friends,
     what shall become of Faustus, being in hell for ever?
