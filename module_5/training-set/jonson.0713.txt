   MOR: So it would rid me of her! and, that I did supererogatory
   penance in a belfry, at Westminster-hall, in the Cock-pit, at the
   fall of a stag; the Tower-wharf (what place is there else?)--
   London-bridge, Paris-garden, Billinsgate, when the noises are at
   their height, and loudest. Nay, I would sit out a play, that were
   nothing but fights at sea, drum, trumpet, and target.
