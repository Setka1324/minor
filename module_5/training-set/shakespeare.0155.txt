  _Ghost._                 I find thee apt;
  And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
  That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,[105]
  Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
  'Tis given out that, sleeping in mine orchard,[106]
  A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
  Is by a forged process[107] of my death
  Rankly abus'd: but know, thou noble youth,
  The serpent that did sting thy father's life
  Now wears his crown.
