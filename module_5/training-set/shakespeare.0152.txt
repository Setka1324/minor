  _Ham._ (C.) Angels and ministers of grace defend us!--
  Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
  Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
  Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
  Thou com'st in such a questionable shape,[89]
  That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee--Hamlet,
  King, father: Royal Dane: O, answer me!
  Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
  Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,[90]
  Have burst their cerements;[91] why the sepulchre,
  Wherein we saw thee quietly in-urn'd,
  Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws,
  To cast thee up again! What may this mean,
  That thou, dead corse, again, in c√≥mplete steel,
  Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
  Making night hideous; and we fools of nature[92]
  So horridly to shake our disposition[93]
  With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
  Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
