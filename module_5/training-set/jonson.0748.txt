   CEN: Good sir Dauphine, do not trust Haughty, nor make any credit
   to her, whatever you do besides. Sir Dauphine, I give you this
   caution, she is a perfect courtier, and loves nobody but for her
   uses: and for her uses she loves all. Besides, her physicians give
   her out to be none o' the clearest, whether she pay them or no,
   heaven knows: and she's above fifty too, and pargets! See her in
   a forenoon. Here comes Mavis, a worse face then she! you would
   not like this, by candle-light.
   [RE-ENTER MAVIS.]
   If you'll come to my chamber one o' these mornings early, or late
   in an evening, I will tell you more. Where's Haughty, Mavis?
