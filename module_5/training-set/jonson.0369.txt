   FAL.  Ay, long since, perhaps;
   But now that sense is alter'd:  you would have me,
   Like to a puddle, or a standing pool,
   To have no motion nor no spirit within me.
   No. I am like a pure and sprightly river,
   That moves for ever, and yet still the same;
   Or fire, that burns much wood, yet still one flame.
