   QUEENE MOTHER. Tush man, let me alone with him,
   To work the way to bring this thing to passe:
   And if he doe deny what I doe say,
   Ile dispatch him with his brother presently.
   And then shall Mounser weare the diadem.
   Tush, all shall dye unles I have my will:
   For while she lives Katherine will be Queene.
   Come my Lord, let us goe to seek the Guise,
   And then determine of this enterprise.
