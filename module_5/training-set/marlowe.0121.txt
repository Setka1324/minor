     FAUSTUS. One thing, good servant, let me crave of thee,
     To glut the longing of my heart's desire,--
     That I may have unto my paramour
     That heavenly Helen which I saw of late,
     Whose sweet embraces may extinguish clean [239]
     Those thoughts that do dissuade me from my vow,
     And keep my oath [240] I made to Lucifer.
