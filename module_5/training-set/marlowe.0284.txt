   And Epernoune though I seeme milde and calme,
   Thinke not but I am tragicall within:
   Ile secretly convey me unto Bloyse,
   For now that Paris takes the Guises parse,
   Heere is not staying for the King of France,
   Unles he means to be betraide and dye:
   But as I live, so sure the Guise shall dye.
