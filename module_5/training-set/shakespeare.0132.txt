  _Hor._ And then it started like a guilty thing
  Upon a fearful summons.[20] I have heard,
  The cock, that is the trumpet of the morn,
  Doth with his lofty[21] and shrill-sounding throat
  Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
  Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
  The extravagant and erring spirit[22] hies
  To his confine.
  But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
  Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastern hill:
  Break we our watch up; and, by my advice,
  Let us impart what we have seen to-night
  Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
  This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
