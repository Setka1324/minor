   GUISE. And now sirs for this night let our fury stay.
   Yet will we not the Massacre shall end:
   Gonzago posse you to Orleance, Retes to Deep,
   Mountsorrell unto Roan, and spare not one
   That you suspect of heresy. And now stay
   That bel that to the devils mattins rings.
   Now every man put of his burgonet,
   And so convey him closely to his bed.
