I UNDERSTAND you, Gentlemen, not your houses:  and a worthy succession of
you, to all time, as being born the judges of these studies.  When I wrote
this poem, I had friendship with divers in your societies; who, as they
were great names in learning, so they were no less examples of living.  Of
them, and then, that I say no more, it was not despised.  Now that the
printer, by a doubled charge, thinks it worthy a longer life than commonly
the air of such things doth promise, I am careful to put it a servant to
their pleasures, who are the inheritors of the first favour born it.  Yet,
I command it lie not in the way of your more noble and useful studies to
the public:  for so I shall suffer for it.  But when the gown and cap is
off, and the lord of liberty reigns, then, to take it in your hands,
perhaps may make some bencher, tincted with humanity, read and not repent
him.
