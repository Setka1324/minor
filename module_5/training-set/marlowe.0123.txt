     LUCIFER. Thus from infernal Dis do we ascend
     To view the subjects of our monarchy,
     Those souls which sin seals the black sons of hell;
     'Mong which, as chief, Faustus, we come to thee,
     Bringing with us lasting damnation
     To wait upon thy soul: the time is come
     Which makes it forfeit.
