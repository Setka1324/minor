   generally; and yet you see, by the fineness and delicacy of their diet,
   diving into the fat capons, drinking your rich wines, feeding on larks,
   sparrows, potato-pies, and such good unctuous meats, how their wits are
   refined and rarified; and sometimes a very quintessence of conceit flows
   from them, able to drown a weak apprehension.
