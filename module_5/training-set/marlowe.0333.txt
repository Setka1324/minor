_Ã†n._ _Achates_ though mine eyes say this is stone,
Yet thinkes my minde that this is _Priamus_:
And when my grieued heart sighes and sayes no,
Then would it leape out to giue _Priam_ life:
O were I not at all so thou mightst be.
_Achates_, see King _Priam_ wags his hand,
He is aliue, _Troy_ is not ouercome.
