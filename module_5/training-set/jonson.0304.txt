   CAR.  O!  look where you are indebted any great sum, your creditor observes
   you with no less regard, than if he were bound to you for some huge
   benefit, and will quake to give you the least cause of offence, lest he
   lose his money.  I assure you, in these
   times, no man has his servant more obsequious and pliant, than gentlemen
   their creditors:  to whom, if at any time you pay but a moiety, or a fourth
   part, it comes more acceptably than if you gave them a new-year's gift.
