   LA-F: They all come out of our house, the La-Fooles of the north, the
   La-Fooles of the west, the La-Fooles of the east and south--we are
   as ancient a family as any is in Europe--but I myself am descended
   lineally of the French La-Fooles--and, we do bear for our coat
   yellow, or or, checker'd azure, and gules, and some three or four
   colours more, which is a very noted coat, and has, sometimes, been
   solemnly worn by divers nobility of our house--but let that go,
   antiquity is not respected now.--I had a brace of fat does sent me,
   gentlemen, and half a dozen of pheasants, a dozen or two of
   godwits, and some other fowl, which I would have eaten, while they
   are good, and in good company:--there will be a great lady, or two,
   my lady Haughty, my lady Centaure, mistress Dol Mavis--and they come
   o' purpose to see the silent gentlewoman, mistress Epicoene, that
   honest sir John Daw has promis'd to bring thither--and then, mistress
   Trusty, my lady's woman, will be there too, and this honourable
   knight, sir Dauphine, with yourself, master Clerimont--and we'll
   be very merry, and have fidlers, and dance.--I have been a mad wag
   in my time, and have spent some crowns since I was a page in
   court, to my lord Lofty, and after, my lady's gentleman-usher, who
   got me knighted in Ireland, since it pleased my elder brother to
   die.--I had as fair a gold jerkin on that day, as any worn in
   the island voyage, or at Cadiz, none dispraised; and I came over in
   it hither, shew'd myself to my friends in court, and after went
   down to my tenants in the country, and surveyed my lands, let
   new leases, took their money, spent it in the eye o' the land
   here, upon ladies:--and now I can take up at my pleasure.
