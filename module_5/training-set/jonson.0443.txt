   he is, and that his masking vizor is off, I'll forbear him no longer.  All
   his lands are mortgaged to me, and forfeited; besides, I have bonds of his
   in my hand, for the receipt of now fifty pounds now a hundred, now two
   hundred; still, as he has had a fan but wagged at him, he would be in a new
   suit.  Well, I'll salute him by a serjeant, the next time I see him
   i'faith, I'll suit him.
