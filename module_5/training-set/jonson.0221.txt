OVER. Master Winwife! I hope you have won no wife of her, sir; if you
have, I will examine the possibility of it, at fit leisure. Now, to my
enormities: look upon me, O London! and see me, O Smithfield! the
example of justice, and Mirrour of Magistrates; the true top of
formality, and scourge of enormity. Hearken unto my labours, and but
observe my discoveries; and compare Hercules with me, if thou dar'st,
of old; or Columbus, Magellan, or our countryman Drake, of later
times. Stand forth, you weeds of enormity, and spread. First, Rabbi
Busy, thou superlunatical hypocrite;--[_to Leatherhead._] Next thou
other extremity, thou profane professor of puppetry, little better
than poetry:--[_to Whit._] Then thou strong debaucher and seducer of
youth; witness this easy and honest young man, [_pointing to
Edgworth._]--[_to Knockem._] Now, thou esquire of dames, madams, and
twelve-penny ladies.--Now, my green madam herself of the price; let me
unmask your ladyship.
