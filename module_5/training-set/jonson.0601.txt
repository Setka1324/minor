   PAGE: No, faith, I'll confess before, sir. The gentlewomen play with
   me, and throw me on the bed; and carry me in to my lady; and she
   kisses me with her oil'd face; and puts a peruke on my head; and
   asks me an I will wear her gown? and I say, no: and then she
   hits me a blow o' the ear, and calls me Innocent! and lets me go.
