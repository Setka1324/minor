QUAR. Stand aside, I'll answer you presently. [_He walks by._] Why
should I not marry this six thousand pound, now I think on't, and a
good trade too that she has beside, ha? The t'other wench Winwife is
sure of; there's no expectation for me there. Here I may make myself
some saver yet, if she continue mad, there's the question. It is money
that I want, why should not I marry the money when 'tis offer'd me? I
have a license and all, it is but razing out one name, and putting in
another. There's no playing with a man's fortune! I am resolved: I
were truly mad an I would not!--Well, come your ways, follow me, an
you will be mad, I'll shew you a warrant!
