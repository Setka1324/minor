                              Such an act,
  That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
  Calls virtue, hypocrite; takes off the rose
  From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
  And sets a blister there;[119] makes marriage vows
  As false as dicer's oaths: O, such a deed
  As from the body of contraction plucks
  The very soul;[120] and sweet religion makes
  A rhapsody of words.--
  Ah, me, that act!
