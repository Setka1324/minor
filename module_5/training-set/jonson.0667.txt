   MRS. OTT: So I adjudged by the physiognomy of the fellow that came
   in; and I had a dream last night too of a new pageant, and my lady
   mayoress, which is always very ominous to me. I told it my lady
   Haughty t'other day; when her honour came hither to see some
   China stuffs: and she expounded it out of Artemidorus, and I have
   found it since very true. It has done me many affronts.
