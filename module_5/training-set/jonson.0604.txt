   TRUE: Why, nothing; or that which, when it is done, is as idle.
   Harken after the next horse-race or hunting-match; lay wagers,
   praise Puppy, or Pepper-corn, White-foot, Franklin; swear upon
   Whitemane's party; speak aloud, that my lords may hear you;
   visit my ladies at night, and be able to give them the character
   of every bowler or better on the green. These be the things
   wherein your fashionable men exercise themselves, and I for
   company.
