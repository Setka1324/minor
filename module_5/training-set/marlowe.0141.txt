    "surgat Mephistophilis, quod tumeraris: The later 4tos have
     "surgat Mephistophilis DRAGON, quod tumeraris."--There is a
     corruption here, which seems to defy emendation.  For "quod
     TUMERARIS," Mr. J. Crossley, of Manchester, would read
     (rejecting the word "Dragon") "quod TU MANDARES" (the
     construction being "quod tu mandares ut Mephistophilis
     appareat et surgat"):  but the "tu" does not agree with the
     preceding "vos."--The Revd. J. Mitford proposes "surgat
     Mephistophilis, per Dragon (or Dagon) quod NUMEN EST AERIS."" ]
