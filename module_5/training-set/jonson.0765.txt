   MOR: Come, nephew, give me the pen. I will subscribe to any
   thing, and seal to what thou wilt, for my deliverance. Thou
   art my restorer. Here, I deliver it thee as my deed. If there
   be a word in it lacking, or writ with false orthography, I
   protest before [heaven] I will not take the advantage.
   [RETURNS THE WRITINGS.]
