    [Footnote V.72: _An union shall he throw_,] _i.e._, a fine pearl.
    To swallow a pearl in a draught seems to have been equally common
    to royal and mercantile prodigality. It may be observed that
    pearls were supposed to possess an exhilarating quality. It was
    generally thrown into the drink as a compliment to some
    distinguished guest, and the King in this scene, under the
    pretence of throwing a pearl into the cup, drops some poisonous
    drug into the wine.]
