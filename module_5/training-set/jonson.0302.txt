   SOG.  Stay, I do not like that humour of challenge, it may be accepted; but
   I'll tell you what's my humour now, I will do this:  I will take occasion
   of sending one of my suits to the tailor's, to have the pocket repaired, or
   so; and there such a letter as you talk of, broke open and all shall be
   left; O, the tailor will presently give out what I am, upon the reading of
   it, worth twenty of your gallants.
