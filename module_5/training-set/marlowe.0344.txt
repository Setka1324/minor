_Venus._ Such bow, such quiuer, and such golden shafts,
Will _Dido_ giue to sweete _Ascanius_:
For _Didos_ sake I take thee in my armes,
And sticke these spangled feathers in thy hat,
Eate Comfites in mine armes, and I will sing.
Now is he fast asleepe, and in this groue
Amongst greene brakes Ile lay _Ascanius_,
And strewe him with sweete smelling Violets,
Blushing Roses, purple _Hyacinthe_:
These milke white Doues shall be his Centronels:
Who if that any seeke to doe him hurt,
Will quickly flye to _Citheidas_ fist.
Now _Cupid_ turne thee to _Ascanius_ shape,
And goe to _Dido_ who in stead of him
Will set thee on her lap and play with thee:
Then touch her white breast with this arrow head,
That she may dote vpon _Ã†neas_ loue:
And by that meanes repaire his broken ships,
Victuall his Souldiers, giue him wealthie gifts,
And he at last depart to _Italy_,
Or els in _Carthage_ make his kingly throne.
