   CAR.  [POINTING TO FASTIDIOUS.]  Who, he?  a gull, a fool, no salt in him
   i' the earth, man; he looks like a fresh salmon kept in a tub; he'll be
   spent shortly.  His brain's lighter than his feather already, and his
   tongue more subject to lye, than that is to wag; he sleeps with a musk-cat
   every night, and walks all day hang'd in pomander chains for penance; he
   has his skin tann'd in civet, to make his complexion strong, and the
   sweetness of his youth lasting in the sense of his sweet lady; a good empty
   puff, he loves you well, signior.
