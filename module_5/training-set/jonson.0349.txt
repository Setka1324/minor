   FUNG.  Faith, uncle, I would have desired you to have made a motion for me
   to my father, in a thing that -- Walk aside, and I'll tell you, sir; no
   more but this:  there's a parcel of law books (some twenty pounds worth)
   that lie in a place for a little more than half the money they cost; and I
   think, for some twelve pound, or twenty mark, I could go near to redeem
   them; there's Plowden, Dyar, Brooke, and Fitz-Herbert, divers such as I
   must have ere long; and you know, I were as good save five or six pound, as
   not, uncle.  I pray you, move it for me.
