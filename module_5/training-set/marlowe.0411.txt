_Anna._ Before I came, _Æneas_ was abourd,
And spying me, hoyst vp the sailes amaine:
But I cride out, _Æneas_, false _Æneas_ stay.
Then gan he wagge his hand, which yet held vp,
Made me suppose he would haue heard me speake:
Then gan they driue into the Ocean,
Which when I viewd, I cride, _Æneas_ stay,
_Dido_, faire _Dido_ wils _Æneas_ stay:
Yet he whose heart of adamant or flint,
My teares nor plaints could mollifie a whit:
Then carelesly I rent my haire for griefe,
Which seene to all, though he beheld me not,
They gan to moue him to redresse my ruth,
And stay a while to heare what I could say,
But he clapt vnder hatches saild away.
