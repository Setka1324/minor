   CAR.  Oh, 'tis Macilente!  Signior, you are well encountered; how is it?
   O, we must not regard what he says, man, a trout, a shallow fool, he has no
   more brain than a butterfly, a mere stuft suit; he looks like a musty
   bottle new wicker'd, his head's the cork, light, light!  [ASIDE TO
   MACILENTE.] -- I am glad to see you so well return'd, signior.
