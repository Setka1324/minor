    [Footnote V.17: _In youth, when I did love, did love._] The three
    stanzas sung here by the Grave-Digger, are extracted, with a
    slight variation, from a little poem called _The Aged Lover
    renounceth Love_, written by Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, who
    was beheaded in 1547. The song is to be found in Dr. Percy's
    _Reliques of Ancient English Poetry_.]
