  _Pol._ It shall do well: But yet I do believe
  The origin and commencement of his grief
  Sprung from neglected love. My lord, do as you please;
  But, if you hold it fit, after the play,
  Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
  To show his grief: let her be round with him;[40]
  And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear
  Of all their conference. If she find him not,[41]
  To England send him; or confine him where
  Your wisdom best shall think.
