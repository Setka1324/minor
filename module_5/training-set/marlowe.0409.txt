_Dido._ Call him not wicked, sister speake him faire,
And looke vpon him with a Mermaides eye,
Tell him, I neuer vow'd at _Aulis_ gulfe
The desolation of his natiue _Troy_,
Nor sent a thousand ships vnto the walles,
Nor euer violated faith to him:
Request him gently (_Anna_) to returne,
I craue but this, he stay a tide or two,
That I may learne to beare it patiently,
If he depart thus suddenly, I dye:
Run _Anna_, run, stay not to answere me.
