_Æn._ O yet this stone doth make _Æneas_ weepe,
And would my prayers (as _Pigmalions_ did)
Could giue it life, that vnder his conduct
We might saile backe to _Troy_ and be reuengde
On these hard harted Grecians; which reioyce
That nothing now is left of _Priamus_:
O _Priamus_ is left and this is he,
Come, come abourd, pursue the hatefull Greekes.
