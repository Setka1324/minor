    [Footnote I.50: _Hyperion to a satyr:_] An allusion to the
    exquisite beauty of Apollo, compared with the deformity of a
    satyr; that satyr, perhaps, being Pan, the brother of Apollo. Our
    great poet is here guilty of a false quantity, by calling
    Hypĕrīon, Hypērĭon, a mistake not unusual among our English
    poets.]
