_Q. Isab._ Ah, boy, our friends do fail us all in France!
   The lords are cruel, and the king unkind.
   What shall we do?
_P. Edw._ Madam, return to England,
   And please my father well; and then a fig
   For all my uncle's friendship here in France!
   I warrant you, I'll win his highness quickly;
   'A loves me better than a thousand Spensers.
_Q. Isab._ Ah, boy, thou art deceiv'd, at least in this,
   To think that we can yet be tun'd together!
   No, no, we jar too far.--Unkind Valois!
   Unhappy Isabel, when France rejects,
   Whither, O, whither dost thou bend thy steps?
