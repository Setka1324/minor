   MRS. OTT: By my integrity, I will send you over to the Bank-side,
   I will commit you to the master of the Garden, if I hear but a
   syllable more. Must my house or my roof be polluted with the
   scent of bears and bulls, when it is perfumed for great ladies?
   Is this according to the instrument, when I married you? that I
   would be princess, and reign in mine own house: and you would be my
   subject, and obey me? What did you bring me, should make you thus
   peremptory? do I allow you your half-crown a day, to spend where
   you will, among your gamsters, to vex and torment me at such
   times as these? Who gives you your maintenance, I pray you? who
   allows you your horse-meat and man's meat? your three suits of
   apparel a year? your four pair of stockings, one silk, three
   worsted? your clean linen, your bands and cuffs, when I can get
   you to wear them?--'tis marle you have them on now.--Who graces you
   with courtiers or great personages, to speak to you out of their
   coaches, and come home to your house? Were you ever so much as
   look'd upon by a lord or a lady, before I married you, but on the
   Easter or Whitsun-holidays? and then out at the banquetting-house
   window, when Ned Whiting or George Stone were at the stake?
