   CHARLES. Madam, it wilbe noted through the world,
   An action bloudy and tirannicall:
   Cheefely since under safetie of our word,
   They justly challenge their protection:
   Besides my heart relentes that noble men,
   Onely corrupted in religion,
   Ladies of honor, Knightes and Gentlemen,
   Should for their conscience taste such rutheles ends.
