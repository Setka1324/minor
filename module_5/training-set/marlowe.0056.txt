     FAUSTUS. Sweet Mephistophilis, thou pleasest me.
     Whilst I am here on earth, let me be cloy'd
     With all things that delight the heart of man:
     My four-and-twenty years of liberty
     I'll spend in pleasure and in dalliance,
     That Faustus' name, whilst [111] this bright frame doth stand,
     May be admir'd thorough [112] the furthest land.
