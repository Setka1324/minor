     FAUSTUS. What might the staying of my blood portend?
     Is it [53] unwilling I should write this bill?
     Why streams it not, that I may write afresh?
     FAUSTUS GIVES TO THEE HIS SOUL:  O, there it stay'd!
     Why shouldst thou not? is not thy soul thine own?
     Then write again, FAUSTUS GIVES TO THEE HIS SOUL. [54]
