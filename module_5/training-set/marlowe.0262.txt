   QUEENE MOTHER. Welcome from Poland Henry once agayne,
   Welcome to France thy fathers royall seate,
   Heere hast thou a country voice of feares,
   A warlike people to maintaine thy right,
   A watchfull Senate for ordaining lawes,
   A loving mother to preserve thy state,
   And all things that a King may wish besides:
   All this and more hath Henry with his crowne.
