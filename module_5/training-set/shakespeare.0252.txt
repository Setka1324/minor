  _Ham._ Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
  The counterfeit presentment[121] of two brothers.
  See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
  Hyp√©rion's curls;[122] the front of Jove himself;
  An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
  A station like the herald Mercury[123]
  New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
  A combination, and a form, indeed,
  Where every god did seem to set his seal,
  To give the world assurance of a man;
  This was your husband.--Look you now, what follows:
  Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
  Blasting his wholesome brother.[124] Have you eyes?
  Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
  And batten on this moor?[125] Ha! have you eyes?
  You cannot call it love; for, at your age
  The hey-day in the blood[126] is tame, it's humble,
  And waits upon the judgment: And what judgment
  Would step from this to this?
  O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
  If thou canst mutine,[127] in a matron's bones,
  To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
  And melt in her own fire.
