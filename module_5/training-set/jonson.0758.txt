   EPI: I will not endure it any longer. Ladies, I beseech you,
   help me. This is such a wrong as never was offered to poor
   bride before: upon her marriage day, to have her husband
   conspire against her, and a couple of mercenary companions
   to be brought in for form's sake, to persuade a separation!
   If you had blood or virtue in you, gentlemen, you would not
   suffer such ear-wigs about a husband, or scorpions to creep
   between man and wife.
