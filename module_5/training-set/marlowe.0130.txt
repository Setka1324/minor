     GOOD ANGEL. O, thou hast lost celestial happiness,
     Pleasures unspeakable, bliss without end
     Hadst thou affected sweet divinity,
     Hell or the devil had had no power on thee:
     Hadst thou kept on that way, Faustus, behold,
          [Music, while a throne descends.]
     In what resplendent glory thou hadst sit [254]
     In yonder throne, like those bright-shining saints,
     And triumph'd over hell!  That hast thou lost;
     And now, poor soul, must thy good angel leave thee:
     The jaws of hell are open [255] to receive thee.
          [Exit.  The throne ascends.]
