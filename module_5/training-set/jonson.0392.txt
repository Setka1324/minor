   PUNT.  'Fore God, Carlo, this is good!  let's read them again.
   [READS THE BILL.
   "If there be any lady or gentlewoman of good carriage that is desirous to
   entertain to her private uses, a young, straight, and upright gentleman, of
   the age of five or six and twenty at the most; who can serve in the nature
   of a gentleman-usher, and hath little legs of purpose, and a black satin
   suit of his own, to go before her in; which suit, for the more sweetening,
   now lies in lavender; and can hide his face with her fan, if need require;
   or sit in the cold at the stair foot for her, as well as another gentleman:
   let her subscribe her name and place, and diligent respect shall be given."
