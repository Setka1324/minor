   TRUE: An excellent animal, equal with your Daw or La-Foole, if not
   transcendant; and does Latin it as much as your barber: He is his
   wife's subject, he calls her princess, and at such times as these
   follows her up and down the house like a page, with his hat off,
   partly for heat, partly for reverence. At this instant he is
   marshalling of his bull, bear, and horse.
