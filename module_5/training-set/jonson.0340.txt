   PUNT.  I have scarce collected my spirits, but lately scattered in the
   administration of your form; to which, if the bounties of your mind be any
   way responsible, I doubt not but my desires shall find a smooth and secure
   passage.  I am a poor knight-errant, lady, that hunting in the adjacent
   forest, was, by adventure, in the pursuit of a hart, brought to this place;
   which hart, dear madam, escaped by enchantment:  the evening approaching
   myself and servant wearied, my suit is, to enter your fair castle and
   refresh me.
