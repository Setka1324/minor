     FAUSTUS. These [153] gracious words, most royal Carolus,
     Shall make poor Faustus, to his utmost power,
     Both love and serve the German Emperor,
     And lay his life at holy Bruno's feet:
     For proof whereof, if so your grace be pleas'd,
     The doctor stands prepar'd by power of art
     To cast his magic charms, that shall pierce through [154]
     The ebon gates of ever-burning hell,
     And hale the stubborn Furies from their caves,
     To compass whatsoe'er your grace commands.
