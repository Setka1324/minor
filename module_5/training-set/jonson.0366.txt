   MACI.  You are too amorous, too obsequious,
   And make her too assured she may command you.
   When women doubt most of their husbands' loves,
   They are most loving.  Husbands must take heed
   They give no gluts of kindness to their wives,
   But use them like their horses; whom they feed
   But half a peck at once; and keep them so
   Still with an appetite to that they give them.
   He that desires to have a loving wife,
   Must bridle all the show of that desire:
   Be kind, not amorous; nor bewraying kindness,
   As if love wrought it, but considerate duty.
   Offer no love rites, but let wives still seek them,
   For when they come unsought, they seldom like them.
