   CAR.  I never hungered so much for anything in my life, as I do to know our
   gallants' success at court; now is that lean, bald-rib Macilente, that salt
   villain, plotting some mischievous device, and lies a soaking in their
   frothy humours like a dry crust, till he has drunk 'em all up:  Could the
   pummice but hold up his eyes at other men's happiness, in any reasonable
   proportion, 'slid, the slave were to be loved next heaven, above honour,
   wealth, rich fare, apparel, wenches, all the delights of the belly and the
   groin, whatever.
