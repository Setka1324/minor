   PLESHE. The vertues of our poor Religion,
   Cannot but march with many graces more:
   Whose army shall discomfort all your foes,
   And at the length in Pampelonia crowne,
   In spite of Spaine and all the popish power,
   That hordes it from your highnesse wrongfully:
   Your Majestie her rightfull Lord and Soveraigne.
