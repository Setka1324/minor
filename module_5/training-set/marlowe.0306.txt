I suspect M^r Warton had no other authority than this for saying
that this play was left imperfect by Marlowe, and completed +
published by Nashe; for it does not appear from the title page
that it was not written in conjunction by him + Marlowe in the
lifetime of the former. Perhaps Nashe's Elegy might ascertain
this point. Tanner had, I believe, no authority but Philipses,
for calling Marlowe an actor.
