     MARTINO. O, yes; and with him comes the German conjurer,
     The learned Faustus, fame of Wittenberg,
     The wonder of the world for magic art;
     And he intends to shew great Carolus
     The race of all his stout progenitors,
     And bring in presence of his majesty
     The royal shapes and perfect [147] semblances
     Of Alexander and his beauteous paramour.
