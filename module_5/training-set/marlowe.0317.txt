What? doe I see my sonne now come on shoare:
_Venus_, how art thou compast with content,
The while thine eyes attract their sought for ioyes:
Great _Iupiter_, still honourd maist thou be,
For this so friendly ayde in time of neede.
Here in this bush disguised will I stand,
Whiles my _Ã†neas_ spends himselfe in plaints,
And heauen and earth with his vnrest acquaints.
