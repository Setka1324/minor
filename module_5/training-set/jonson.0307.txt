   MAC.  Torment and death!  break head and brain at once,
   To be deliver'd of your fighting issue.
   Who can endure to see blind Fortune dote thus?
   To be enamour'd on this dusty turf,
   This clod, a whoreson puck-fist!  O G----!
   I could run wild with grief now, to behold
   The rankness of her bounties, that doth breed
   Such bulrushes; these mushroom gentlemen,
   That shoot up in a night to place and worship.
