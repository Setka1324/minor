     CARTER. I'll tell you how he served me.  As I was going to
     Wittenberg, t'other day, [205] with a load of hay, he met me, and
     asked me what he should give me for as much hay as he could eat.
     Now, sir, I thinking that a little would serve his turn, bad him
     take as much as he would for three farthings:  so he presently
     gave me my [206] money and fell to eating; and, as I am a cursen [207]
     man, he never left eating till he had eat up all my load of hay.
