   DAUP: 'Fore heav'n, you have undone me. That which I have plotted
   for, and been maturing now these four months, you have blasted in a
   minute: Now I am lost, I may speak. This gentlewoman was lodged
   here by me o' purpose, and, to be put upon my uncle, hath profest
   this obstinate silence for my sake; being my entire friend, and
   one that for the requital of such a fortune as to marry him,
   would have made me very ample conditions: where now, all my hopes
   are utterly miscarried by this unlucky accident.
