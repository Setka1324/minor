_Anna._ What can my teares or cryes preuaile me now?
_Dido_ is dead, _Iarbus_ slaine, _Iarbus_ my deare loue,
O sweet _Iarbus_, _Annas_ sole delight,
What fatall destinie enuies me thus,
To see my sweet _Iarbus_ slay himselfe?
But _Anna_ now shall honor thee in death,
And mixe her bloud with thine, this shall I doe,
That Gods and men may pitie this my death,
And rue our ends senceles of life or breath;
Now sweet _Iarbus_ stay, I come to thee.
