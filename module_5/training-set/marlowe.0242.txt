   GUISE. Thus Madame.
   They that shalbe actors in this Massacre,
   Shall weare white crosses on their Burgonets,
   And tye white linnen scarfes about their armes.
   He that wantes these, and is suspect of heresie,
   Shall dye, or be he King or Emperour.
   Then Ile have a peale of ordinance shot from the tower,
   At which they all shall issue out and set the streetes.
   And then the watchword being given, a bell shall ring,
   Which when they heare, they shall begin to kill:
   And never cease untill that bell shall cease,
   Then breath a while.
