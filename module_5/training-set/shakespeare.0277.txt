    [Footnote III.87: _I could interpret between you and your love,
    if I could see the puppets dallying._] This refers to the
    interpreter, who formerly sat on the stage at all _puppet shows_,
    and explained to the audience. _The puppets dallying_ are here
    made to signify to the agitations of Ophelia's bosom.]
