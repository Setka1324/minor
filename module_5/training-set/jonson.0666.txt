   CUT: One that has catch'd a cold, sir, and can scarce be heard six
   inches off; as if he spoke out of a bulrush that were not pick'd,
   or his throat were full of pith: a fine quick fellow, and an
   excellent barber of prayers. I came to tell you, sir, that you
   might omnem movere lapidem, as they say, be ready with your
   vexation.
