URS. An you be right Bartholomew birds, now show yourselves so: we are
undone for want of fowl in the Fair, here. Here will be Zekiel
Edgworth, and three or four gallants with him at night, and I have
neither plover nor quail for them: persuade this between you two, to
become a bird o' the game, while I work the velvet woman within, as
you call her.
