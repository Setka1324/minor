   DAUP: I thank you, good doctor Cutbeard, and parson Otter.
   [PULLS THEIR FALSE BEARDS AND GOWNS OFF.]
   You are beholden to them, sir, that have taken this pains for
   you; and my friend, master Truewit, who enabled them for the
   business. Now you may go in and rest; be as private as you
   will, sir.
   [EXIT MOROSE.]
   I'll not trouble you, till you trouble me with your funeral,
   which I care not how soon it come.
   --Cutbeard, I'll make your lease good. "Thank me not, but with
   your leg, Cutbeard." And Tom Otter, your princess shall be
   reconciled to you.--How now, gentlemen, do you look at me?
