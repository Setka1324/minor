_Iar._ Come forth the Caue: can heauen endure this sight?
_Iarbus_, curse that vnreuenging _Ioue_,
Whose flintie darts slept in _Tiphous_ den,
Whiles these adulterers surfetted with sinne:
Nature, why mad'st me not some poysonous beast,
That with the sharpnes of my edged sting,
I might haue stakte them both vnto the earth,
Whil'st they were sporting in this darksome Caue?
