   MAC.  O, here's a precious, dirty, damned rogue,
   That fats himself with expectation
   Of rotten weather, and unseason'd hours;
   And he is rich for it, an elder brother!
   His barns are full, his ricks and mows well trod,
   His garners crack with store!  O, 'tis well; ha, ha, ha!
   A plague consume thee, and thy house!
