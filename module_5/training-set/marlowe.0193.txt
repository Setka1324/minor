_Kent._ Madam, long may you live,
   Much happier than your friends in England do!
_Q. Isab._ Lord Edmund and Lord Mortimer alive!
   Welcome to France! the news was here, my lord,
   That you were dead, or very near your death.
_Y. Mor._ Lady, the last was truest of the twain:
   But Mortimer, reserv'd for better hap,
   Hath shaken off the thraldom of the Tower,
   And lives t' advance your standard, good my lord.
_P. Edw._ How mean you, and the king my father lives?
   No, my Lord Mortimer, not I, I trow.
_Q. Isab._ Not, son! Why not?  I would it were no worse!--
   But, gentle lords, friendless we are in France.
_Y. Mor._ Monsieur Le Grand, a noble friend of yours,
   Told us, at our arrival, all the news,--
   How hard the nobles, how unkind the king
   Hath show'd himself: but, madam, right makes room
   Where weapons want; and, though a many friends
   Are made away, as Warwick, Lancaster,
   And others of our part and faction,
   Yet have we friends, assure your grace, in England,
   Would cast up caps, and clap their hands for joy,
   To see us there, appointed for our foes.
_Kent._ Would all were well, and Edward well reclaim'd,
   For England's honour, peace, and quietness!
_Y. Mor._ But by the sword, my lord, 't must be deserv'd:
   The king will ne'er forsake his flatterers.
_Sir J._ My lords of England, sith th' ungentle king
   Of France refuseth to give aid of arms
   To this distressed queen, his sister, here,
   Go you with her to Hainault: doubt ye not
   We will find comfort, money, men, and friends,
   Ere long to bid the English king a base.--
   How say'st, young prince, what think you of the match?
_P. Edw._ I think King Edward will outrun us all.
_Q. Isab._ Nay, son, not so; and you must not discourage
   Your friends that are so forward in your aid.
_Kent._ Sir John of Hainault, pardon us, I pray:
   These comforts that you give our woful queen
   Bind us in kindness all at your command.
_Q. Isab._ Yea, gentle brother:--and the God of heaven
   Prosper your happy motion, good Sir John!
_Y. Mor._ This noble gentleman, forward in arms,
   Was born, I see, to be our anchor-hold.--
   Sir John of Hainault, be it thy renown,
   That England's queen and nobles in distress
   Have been by thee restor'd and comforted.
_Sir J._ Madam, along; and you, my lord[s], with me,
   That England's peers may Hainault's welcome see.            [_Exeunt._
