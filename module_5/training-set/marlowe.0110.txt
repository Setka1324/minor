     FAUSTUS. I do think myself, my good lord, highly recompensed in
     that it pleaseth [212] your grace to think but well of that which
     Faustus hath performed.--But, gracious lady, it may be that you
     have taken no pleasure in those sights; therefore, I pray you
     tell me, what is the thing you most desire to have; be it in the
     world, it shall be yours: I have heard that great-bellied women
     do long for things are rare and dainty.
