   KING. They were to blame that said I was displeasde,
   And you good Cosin to imagine it.
   Twere hard with me if I should doubt my kinne,
   Or be suspicious of my deerest freends:
   Cousin, assure you I am resolute,
   Whatever any whisper in mine eares,
   Not to suspect disloyaltye in thee,
   And so sweet Cuz farwell.
