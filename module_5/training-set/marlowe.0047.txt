     WRATH. I am Wrath.  I had neither father nor mother:  I leapt
     out of a lion's mouth when I was scarce an hour old; and ever
     since have run [82] up and down the world with this [83] case of
     rapiers, wounding myself when I could get none to fight withal.
     I was born in hell; and look to it, for some of you shall be my
     father.
