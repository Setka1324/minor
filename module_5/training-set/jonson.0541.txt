   MACI.  What!  do you sigh?  this is to 'kiss the hand of a countess', to
   'have her coach sent for you', to 'hang poniards in ladies' garters', to
   'wear bracelets of their hair', and for every one of these great favours to
   'give some slight jewel of five hundred crowns, or so'; why, 'tis nothing.
   Now, monsieur, you see the plague that treads on the heels o' your foppery:
   well, go your ways in, remove yourself to the two-penny ward quickly, to
   save charges, and there set up your rest to spend sir Puntarvolo's hundred
   pound for him.  Away, good pomander, go!
   [EXIT FASTIDIOUS.
   Why here's a change!  now is my soul at peace:
   I am as empty of all envy now,
   As they of merit to be envied at.
   My humour, like a flame, no longer lasts
   Than it hath stuff to feed it; and their folly
   Being now raked up in their repentant ashes,
   Affords no ampler subject to my spleen.
   I am so far from malicing their states,
   That I begin to pity them.  It grieves me
   To think they have a being.  I could wish
   They might turn wise upon it, and be saved now,
   So heaven were pleased; but let them vanish, vapours! --
   Gentlemen, how like you it?  has't not been tedious?
