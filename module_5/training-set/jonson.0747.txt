   HAU: I come presently, Centaure.--My chamber, sir, my page shall
   shew you; and Trusty, my woman, shall be ever awake for you: you
   need not fear to communicate any thing with her, for she is a
   Fidelia. I pray you wear this jewel for my sake, sir Dauphine.--
   [ENTER CENTAURE.]
   Where is Mavis, Centaure?
