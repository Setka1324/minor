   FAL.  Here's a sweet stink indeed!
   What, shall I ever be thus crost and plagued,
   And sick of husband?  O, my head doth ache,
   As it would cleave asunder, with these savours!
   All my rooms alter'd, and but one poor walk
   That I delighted in, and that is made
   So fulsome with perfumes, that I am fear'd,
   My brain doth sweat so, I have caught the plague!
