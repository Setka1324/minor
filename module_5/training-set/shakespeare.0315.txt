    [Footnote IV.24: _There's rosemary, that's for remembrance_;]
    Rosemary was anciently supposed to strengthen the memory, and was
    carried at funerals and wore at weddings. It was also considered
    the emblem of fidelity in lovers; and at weddings it was usual to
    dip the rosemary in the cup, and drink to the health of the new
    married couple.]
