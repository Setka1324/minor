     ENVY. I am Envy, begotten of a chimney-sweeper and an oyster-wife.
     I cannot read, and therefore wish all books burned.  I am lean
     with seeing others eat.  O, that there would come a famine over
     all the world, that all might die, and I live alone! then thou
     shouldst see how fat I'd be.  But must thou sit, and I stand?
     come down, with a vengeance!
