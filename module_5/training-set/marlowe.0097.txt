     Go, horse these traitors on your fiery backs,
     And mount aloft with them as high as heaven:
     Thence pitch them headlong to the lowest hell.
     Yet, stay: the world shall see their misery,
     And hell shall after plague their treachery.
     Go, Belimoth, and take this caitiff hence,
     And hurl him in some lake of mud and dirt.
     Take thou this other, drag him through [190] the woods
     Amongst [191] the pricking thorns and sharpest briers;
     Whilst, with my gentle Mephistophilis,
     This traitor flies unto some steepy rock,
     That, rolling down, may break the villain's bones,
     As he intended to dismember me.
     Fly hence; despatch my charge immediately.
