   PUNT.  Stay; mine eye hath, on the instant, through the bounty of the
   window, received the form of a nymph.  I will step forward three paces; of
   the which, I will barely retire one; and, after some little flexure of the
   knee, with an erected grace salute her; one, two, and three!  Sweet lady,
   God save you!
