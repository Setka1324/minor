   MRS. OTT: By that light, I'll have you chain'd up, with your
   bull-dogs, and bear-dogs, if you be not civil the sooner. I will
   send you to kennel, i'faith. You were best bait me with your bull,
   bear, and horse! Never a time that the courtiers or collegiates
   come to the house, but you make it a Shrove-tuesday! I would have
   you get your Whitsuntide velvet cap, and your staff in your hand,
   to entertain them: yes, in troth, do.
