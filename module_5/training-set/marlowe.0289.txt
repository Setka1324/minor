   GUISE. So,
   Now sues the King for favour to the Guise,
   And all his Minions stoup when I commaund:
   Why this tis to have an army in the fielde.
   Now by the holy sacrament I sweare,
   As ancient Romanes over their Captive Lords,
   So will I triumph over this wanton King,
   And he shall follow my proud Chariots wheeles.
   Now doe I but begin to look about,
   And all my former time was spent in vaine:
   Holde Sworde,
   For in thee is the Guises hope.
