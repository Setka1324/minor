   SORD.  O here, "St. Swithin's, the 15 day, variable weather, for the most
   part rain", good!  "for the most part rain":  why, it should rain forty
   days after, now, more or less, it was a rule held, afore I was able to hold
   a plough, and yet here are two days no rain; ha!  it makes me muse.  We'll
   see how the next month begins, if that be better.  "August 1, 2, 3, and 4,
   days, rainy and blustering:"  this is well now:  "5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, rainy,
   with some thunder;"  Ay marry, this is excellent; the other was false
   printed sure:  "the 10 and 11, great store of rain"; O good, good, good,
   good, good!  "the 12, 13, and 14 days, rain"; good still:  "15, and 16,
   rain"; good still:  "17 and 18, rain", good still:  "19 and 20", good
   still, good still, good still, good still, good still!  "21, some rain";
   some rain!  well, we must be patient, and attend the heaven's pleasure,
   would it were more though:  "the 22, 23, great tempests of rain, thunder
   and lightning".
   O good again, past expectation good!
   I thank my blessed angel; never, never
   Laid I [a] penny better out than this,
   To purchase this dear book:  not dear for price,
    And yet of me as dearly prized as life,
   Since in it is contain'd the very life,
   Blood, strength, and sinews, of my happiness.
   Blest be the hour wherein I bought this book;
   His studies happy that composed the book,
   And the man fortunate that sold the book!
   Sleep with this charm, and be as true to me,
   As I am joy'd and confident in thee
   [PUTS IT UP.
