_Iar._ Come seruants, come bring forth the Sacrifize,
That I may pacifie that gloomie _Ioue_,
Whose emptie Altars haue enlarg'd our illes.
Eternall _Ioue_, great master of the Clowdes,
Father of gladnesse, and all frollicke thoughts,
That with thy gloomie hand corrects the heauen,
When ayrie creatures warre amongst themselues:
Heare, heare, O heare _Iarbus_ plaining prayers,
Whose hideous ecchoes make the welkin howle,
And all the woods _Eliza_ to resound:
The woman that thou wild vs entertaine,
Where straying in our borders vp and downe,
She crau'd a hide of ground to build a towne,
With whom we did deuide both lawes and land,
And all the fruites that plentie els sends forth,
Scorning our loues and royall marriage rites,
Yeelds vp her beautie to a strangers bed,
Who hauing wrought her shame, is straight way fled:
Now if thou beest a pitying God of power,
On whom ruth and compassion euer waites,
Redresse these wrongs, and warne him to his ships,
That now afflicts me with his flattering eyes.
