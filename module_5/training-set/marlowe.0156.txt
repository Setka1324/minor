_Y. Mor._ Madam, whither walks your majesty so fast?
_Q. Isab._ Unto the forest, gentle Mortimer,
   To live in grief and baleful discontent;
   For now my lord the king regards me not,
   But dotes upon the love of Gaveston:
   He claps his cheeks, and hangs about his neck,
   Smiles in his face, and whispers in his ears;
   And, when I come, he frowns, as who should say,
   "Go whither thou wilt, seeing I have Gaveston."
_E. Mor._ Is it not strange that he is thus bewitch'd?
_Y. Mor._ Madam, return unto the court again:
   That sly inveigling Frenchman we'll exile,
   Or lose our lives; and yet, ere that day come,
   The king shall lose his crown; for we have power,
   And courage too, to be reveng'd at full.
_Archb. of Cant._ But yet lift not your swords against the king.
_Lan._ No; but we will lift Gaveston from hence.
_War._ And war must be the means, or he'll stay still.
_Q. Isab._ Then let him stay; for, rather than my lord
   Shall be oppress'd with civil mutinies,
   I will endure a melancholy life,
   And let him frolic with his minion.
_Archb. of Cant._ My lords, to ease all this, but hear me speak:
   We and the rest, that are his counsellors,
   Will meet, and with a general consent
   Confirm his banishment with our hands and seals.
_Lan._ What we confirm the king will frustrate.
_Y. Mor._ Then may we lawfully revolt from him.
_War._ But say, my lord, where shall this meeting be?
_Archb. of Cant._ At the New Temple.
_Y. Mor._ Content.
_Archb. of Cant._ And, in the meantime, I'll entreat you all
   To cross to Lambeth, and there stay with me.
_Lan._ Come, then, let's away.
_Y. Mor._ Madam, farewell.
_Q. Isab._ Farewell, sweet Mortimer, and, for my sake,
   Forbear to levy arms against the king.
_Y. Mor._ Ay, if words will serve; if not, I must.             [_Exeunt._
