     BENVOLIO. Then, gentle Frederick, hie thee to the grove,
     And place our servants and our followers
     Close in an [179] ambush there behind the trees.
     By this, I know the conjurer is near:
     I saw him kneel, and kiss the Emperor's hand,
     And take his leave, laden with rich rewards.
     Then, soldiers, boldly [180] fight:  if Faustus die,
     Take you the wealth, leave us the victory.
