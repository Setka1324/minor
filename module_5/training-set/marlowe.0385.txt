_Dido._ O _Anna_, runne vnto the water side,
They say _Ã†neas_ men are going abourd,
It may be he will steale away with them:
Stay not to answere me, runne _Anna_ runne.
O foolish Troians that would steale from hence,
And not let _Dido_ vnderstand their drift:
I would haue giuen _Achates_ store of gold,
And _Illioneus_ gum and Libian spice,
The common souldiers rich imbrodered coates,
And siluer whistles to controule the windes,
Which _Circes_ sent _Sicheus_ when he liued:
Vnworthie are they of a Queenes reward:
See where they come, how might I doe to chide?
