   GUISE. My Lord, to speak more plainely, thus it is:
   Being animated by Religious zeale,
   I meane to muster all the power I can,
   To overthrow those factious Puritans:
   And know, the Pope will sell his triple crowne,
   I, and the catholick Philip King of Spaine,
   Ere I shall want, will cause his Indians,
   To rip the golden bowels of America.
   Navarre that cloakes them underneath his wings,
   Shall feele the house of Lorayne is his foe:
   Your highnes need not feare mine armies force,
   Tis for your safetie and your enemies wrack.
