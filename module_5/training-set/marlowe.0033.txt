     FAUSTUS. Consummatum est; this bill is ended,
     And Faustus hath bequeath'd his soul to Lucifer.
     But what is this inscription on mine arm?
     Homo, fuge:  whither should [56] I fly?
     If unto God, [57] he'll throw me down to hell.
     My senses are deceiv'd; here's nothing writ:--
     O, yes, I see it plain; even here is writ,
     Homo, fuge:  yet shall not Faustus fly.
