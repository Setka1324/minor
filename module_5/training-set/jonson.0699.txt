   TRUE: Yes, but you must leave to live in your chamber, then, a
   month together upon Amadis de Gaul, or Don Quixote, as you are
   wont; and come abroad where the matter is frequent, to court, to
   tiltings, public shows and feasts, to plays, and church sometimes:
   thither they come to shew their new tires too, to see, and to be
   seen. In these places a man shall find whom to love, whom to play
   with, whom to touch once, whom to hold ever. The variety arrests
   his judgment. A wench to please a man comes not down dropping
   from the ceiling, as he lies on his back droning a tobacco pipe.
   He must go where she is.
