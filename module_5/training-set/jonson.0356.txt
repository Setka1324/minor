   PUNT.  I do intend, this year of jubilee coming on, to travel:  and because
   I will not altogether go upon expense, I am determined to put forth some
   five thousand pound, to be paid me five for one, upon the return of myself,
   my wife, and my dog from the Turk's court in Constantinople.  If all or
   either of us miscarry in the journey, 'tis gone:  if we be successful, why,
   there will be five and twenty thousand pound to entertain time withal.
   Nay, go not, neighbour Sordido; stay to-night, and help to make our society
   the fuller.  Gentlemen, frolic:  Carlo!  what!  dull now?
