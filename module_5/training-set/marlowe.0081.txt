     EMPEROR. Wonder of men, renowm'd [151] magician,
     Thrice-learned Faustus, welcome to our court.
     This deed of thine, in setting Bruno free
     From his and our professed enemy,
     Shall add more excellence unto thine art
     Than if by powerful necromantic spells
     Thou couldst command the world's obedience:
     For ever be belov'd of Carolus!
     And if this Bruno, thou hast late redeem'd,
     In peace possess the triple diadem,
     And sit in Peter's chair, despite of chance,
     Thou shalt be famous through [152] all Italy,
     And honour'd of the German Emperor.
