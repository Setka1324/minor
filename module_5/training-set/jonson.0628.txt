   never thought of the like. Daw does nothing but court her; and the
   wrong way. He would lie with her, and praises her modesty; desires
   that she would talk and be free, and commends her silence in

   made. Then rails at his fortunes, stamps, and mutines, why he is
   not made a counsellor, and call'd to affairs of state.
