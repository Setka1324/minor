    [Footnote III.25: _If you be honest and fair, your honesty should
    admit no discourse to your beauty._] _i.e._, if you really
    possess these qualities, chastity and beauty, and mean to support
    the character of both, your honesty should be so chary of your
    beauty, as not to suffer a thing so fragile to entertain
    discourse, or to be parleyed with.
