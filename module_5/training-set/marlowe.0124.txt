     MEPHIST. How should he but in desperate lunacy?
     Fond worldling, now his heart-blood dries with grief;
     His conscience kills it; and his [244] labouring brain
     Begets a world of idle fantasies
     To over-reach the devil; but all in vain;
     His store of pleasures must be sauc'd with pain.
     He and his servant Wagner are at hand;
     Both come from drawing Faustus' latest will.
     See, where they come!
