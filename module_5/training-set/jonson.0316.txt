   MAC.  Ha, ha, ha!
   Is not this good?  Is not pleasing this?
   Ha, ha, ha!  God pardon me!  ha, ha!
   Is't possible that such a spacious villain
   Should live, and not be plagued?  or lies be hid
   Within the wrinkled bosom of the world,
   Where Heaven cannot see him?  S'blood!  methinks
   'Tis rare, and strange, that he should breathe and walk,
   Feed with digestion, sleep, enjoy his health,
   And, like a boisterous whale swallowing the poor,
   Still swim in wealth and pleasure!  is't not strange?
   Unless his house and skin were thunder proof,
   I wonder at it!  Methinks, now, the hectic,
   Gout, leprosy, or some such loath'd disease,
   Might light upon him; of that fire from heaven
   Might fall upon his barns; or mice and rats
   Eat up his grain; or else that it might rot
   Within the hoary ricks, even as it stands:
   Methinks this might be well; and after all
   The devil might come and fetch him.  Ay, 'tis true!
   Meantime he surfeits in prosperity,
   And thou, in envy of him, gnaw'st thyself:
   Peace, fool, get hence, and tell thy vexed spirit,
   Wealth in this age will scarcely look on merit.
