My hope is not so nourished by example, as it will conclude, this dumb
piece should please you, because it hath pleased others before; but by
trust, that when you have read it, you will find it worthy to have
displeased none. This makes that I now number you, not only in the names
of favour, but the names of justice to what I write; and do presently
call you to the exercise of that noblest, and manliest virtue; as
coveting rather to be freed in my fame, by the authority of a judge,
than the credit of an undertaker. Read, therefore, I pray you, and
censure. There is not a line, or syllable in it, changed from the
simplicity of the first copy. And, when you shall consider, through the
certain hatred of some, how much a man's innocency may be endangered by
an uncertain accusation; you will, I doubt not, so begin to hate the
iniquity of such natures, as I shall love the contumely done me, whose
end was so honourable as to be wiped off by your sentence.
