_Dido._ These words are poyson to poore _Didos_ soule,
O speake like my _Æneas_, like my loue:
Why look'st thou toward the sea? the time hath been
When _Didos_ beautie chaungd thine eyes to her;
Am I lesse faire then when thou sawest me first?
O then _Æneas_, tis for griefe of thee:
Say thou wilt stay in _Carthage_ with my Queene,
And _Didos_ beautie will returne againe:
_Æneas_, say, how canst thou take thy leaue?
Wilt thou kisse _Dido_? O thy lips haue sworne
To stay with _Dido_: canst thou take her hand?
Thy Hand and mine haue plighted mutuall faith,
Therefore vnkinde _Æneas_, must thou say,
Then let me goe, and neuer say farewell.
