   MACI.  Ay, to my grief.  O, that such muddy flags,
   For every drunken flourish should achieve
   The name of manhood, whilst true perfect valour,
   Hating to shew itself, goes by despised!
   Heart!  I do know now, in a fair just cause,
   I dare do more than he, a thousand times;
   Why should not they take knowledge of this, ha!
   And give my worth allowance before his?
   Because I cannot swagger. -- Now, the pox
   Light on your Pickt-hatch prowess!
