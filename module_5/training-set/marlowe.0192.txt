_Sir J._ Madam, what cheer?
_Q. Isab._ Ah, good Sir John of Hainault,
   Never so cheerless nor so far distrest!
_Sir J._ I hear, sweet lady, of the king's unkindness:
   But droop not, madam; noble minds contemn
   Despair.  Will your grace with me to Hainault,
   And there stay time's advantage with your son?--
   How say you, my lord! will you go with your friends,
   And shake off all our fortunes equally?
_P. Edw._ So pleaseth the queen my mother, me it likes:
   The king of England, not the court of France,
   Shall have me from my gracious mother's side,
   Till I be strong enough to break a staff;
   And then have at the proudest Spenser's head!
_Sir J._ Well said, my lord!
_Q. Isab._ O my sweet heart, how do I moan thy wrongs,
   Yet triumph in the hope of thee, my joy!--
   Ah, sweet Sir John, even to the utmost verge
   Of Europe, on the shore of Tanais,
   Will we with thee to Hainault--so we will:
   The marquis is a noble gentleman;
   His grace, I dare presume, will welcome me.--
   But who are these?
