   CLER: O, in the Queen's time, he was wont to go out of town every
   Saturday at ten o'clock, or on holy day eves. But now, by reason of
   the sickness, the perpetuity of ringing has made him devise a
   room, with double walls, and treble ceilings; the windows close
   shut and caulk'd: and there he lives by candlelight. He turn'd away
   a man, last week, for having a pair of new shoes that creak'd.
   And this fellow waits on him now in tennis-court socks, or slippers
   soled with wool: and they talk each to other in a trunk. See, who
   comes here!
