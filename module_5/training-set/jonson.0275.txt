   ASP.  Away!
   Who is so patient of this impious world,
   That he can check his spirit, or rein his tongue?
   Or who hath such a dead unfeeling sense,
   That heaven's horrid thunders cannot wake?
   To see the earth crack'd with the weight of sin,
   Hell gaping under us, and o'er our heads
   Black, ravenous ruin, with her sail-stretch'd wings,
   Ready to sink us down, and cover us.
   Who can behold such prodigies as these,
   And have his lips seal'd up?  Not I:  my soul
   Was never ground into such oily colours,
   To flatter vice, and daub iniquity:
   But, with an armed and resolved hand,
   I'll strip the ragged follies of the time
   Naked as at their birth --
