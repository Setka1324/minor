_War._ My Lord of Pembroke's men,
   Strive you no longer: I will have that Gaveston.
_James._ Your lordship doth dishonour to yourself,
   And wrong our lord, your honourable friend.
_War._ No, James, it is my country's cause I follow.--
   Go, take the villain: soldiers, come away;
   We'll make quick work.--Commend me to your master,
   My friend, and tell him that I watch'd it well.--
   Come, let thy shadow parley with King Edward.
_Gav._ Treacherous earl, shall I not see the king?
_War._ The king of heaven perhaps, no other king.--
   Away!                    [_Exeunt Warwick and Soldiers with Gaveston._
_James._ Come, fellows: it booted not for us to strive:
   We will in haste go certify our lord.                       [_Exeunt._
