   TRUE: No; I like him well. Men should love wisely, and all women;
   some one for the face, and let her please the eye; another for
   the skin, and let her please the touch; a third for the voice, and
   let her please the ear; and where the objects mix, let the senses
   so too. Thou would'st think it strange, if I should make them all
   in love with thee afore night!
