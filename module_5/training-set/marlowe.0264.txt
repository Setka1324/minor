   KING. Hands of good fellow, I will be his baile
   For this offence: goe sirra, worke no more,
   Till this our Coronation day be past:
   And now,
   Our rites of Coronation done,
   What now remaines, but for a while to feast,
   And spend some daies in barriers, tourny, tylte,
   And like disportes, such as doe fit the Coutr?
   Lets goe my Lords, our dinner staies for us.
