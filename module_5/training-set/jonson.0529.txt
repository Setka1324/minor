   MACI.  Troth, the time allows no circumstance, lady, therefore know this
   was but a device to remove your husband hence, and bestow him securely,
   whilst, with more conveniency, I might report to you a misfortune that hath
   happened to monsieur Brisk -- Nay, comfort, sweet lady.  This night, being
   at supper, a sort of young gallants committed a riot, for the which he only
   is apprehended and carried to the Counter, where, if your husband, and
   other creditors, should but have knowledge of him, the poor gentleman were
   undone for ever.
