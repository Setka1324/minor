     PRIDE. I am Pride.  I disdain to have any parents.  I am like to
     Ovid's flea; I can creep into every corner of a wench; sometimes,
     like a perriwig, I sit upon her brow; next, like a necklace, I hang
     about her neck; then, like a fan of feathers, I kiss her lips; [81]
     and then, turning myself to a wrought smock, do what I list.
     But, fie, what a smell is here!  I'll not speak a word more for
     a king's ransom, unless the ground be perfumed, and covered with
     cloth of arras.
