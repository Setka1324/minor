_Iup._ I will take order for that presently:
_Hermes_ awake, and haste to _Neptunes_ realme,
Whereas the Wind-god warring now with Fate,
Besiege the ofspring of our kingly loynes,
Charge him from me to turne his stormie powers,
And fetter them in _Vulcans_ sturdie brasse,
That durst thus proudly wrong our kinsmans peace.
_Venus_ farewell, thy sonne shall be our care:
Come _Ganimed_, we must about this geare.
