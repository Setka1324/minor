    "he desires: Not in any of the four 4tos.  In the tract just
     cited,  i.e. THE HISTORY OF DOCTOR FAUSTUS, ed. 1648.  the
     "3d Article" stands thus,--"That Mephostophiles should bring
     him any thing, and doe for him whatsoever."  Sig. A 4, ed.
     1648.  A later ed. adds "he desired."  Marlowe, no doubt,
     followed some edition of the HISTORY in which these words,
     or something equivalent to them, had been omitted by mistake.
     (2to 1661, which I consider as of no authority, has "he
     requireth.")" ]
