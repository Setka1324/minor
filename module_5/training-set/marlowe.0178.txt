_Lan._ How now, my Lord of Arundel!
_Arun._ My lords, King Edward greets you all by me.
_War._ Arundel, say your message.
_Arun._ His majesty, hearing that you had taken Gaveston,
   Entreateth you by me, yet but he may
   See him before he dies; for why, he says,
   And sends you word, he knows that die he shall;
   And, if you gratify his grace so far,
   He will be mindful of the courtesy.
_War._ How now!
_Gav._ Renowmed Edward, how thy name
   Revives poor Gaveston!
_War._ No, it needeth not:
   Arundel, we will gratify the king
   In other matters; he must pardon us in this.--
   Soldiers, away with him!
_Gav._ Why, my Lord of Warwick,
   Will now these short delays beget my hopes?
   I know it, lords, it is life you aim at,
   Yet grant King Edward this.
_Y. Mor._ Shalt thou appoint
   What we shall grant?--Soldiers, away with him!--
   Thus we'll gratify the king;
   We'll send his head by thee; let him bestow
   His tears on that, for that is all he gets
   Of Gaveston, or else his senseless trunk.
_Lan._ Not so, my lord, lest he bestow more cost
   In burying him than he hath ever earn'd.
_Arun._ My lords, it is his majesty's request,
   And in the honour of a king he swears,
   He will but talk with him, and send him back.
_War._ When, can you tell?  Arundel, no; we wot
   He that the care of his realm remits,
   And drives his nobles to these exigents
   For Gaveston, will, if he seize him once,
   Violate any promise to possess him.
_Arun._ Then, if you will not trust his grace in keep,
   My lords, I will be pledge for his return.
_Y. Mor._ 'Tis honourable in thee to offer this;
   But, for we know thou art a noble gentleman,
   We will not wrong thee so,
   To make away a true man for a thief.
_Gav._ How mean'st thou, Mortimer? that is over-base.
_Y. Mor._ Away, base groom, robber of king's renown!
   Question with thy companions and mates.
_Pem._ My Lord Mortimer, and you, my lords, each one,
   To gratify the king's request therein,
   Touching the sending of this Gaveston,
   Because his majesty so earnestly
   Desires to see the man before his death,
   I will upon mine honour undertake
   To carry him, and bring him back again;
   Provided this, that you, my Lord of Arundel,
   Will join with me.
_War._ Pembroke, what wilt thou do?
   Cause yet more bloodshed? is it not enough
   That we have taken him, but must we now
   Leave him on "Had I wist," and let him go?
_Pem._ My lords, I will not over-woo your honours:
   But, if you dare trust Pembroke with the prisoner,
   Upon mine oath, I will return him back.
_Arun._ My Lord of Lancaster, what say you in this?
_Lan._ Why, I say, let him go on Pembroke's word.
_Pem._ And you, Lord Mortimer?
_Y. Mor._ How say you, my Lord of Warwick?
_War._ Nay, do your pleasures: I know how 'twill prove.
_Pem._ Then give him me.
_Gav._ Sweet sovereign, yet I come
   To see thee ere I die!
_War._ Yet not perhaps,
   If Warwick's wit and policy prevail.                         [_Aside._
_Y. Mor._ My Lord of Pembroke, we deliver him you:
   Return him on your honour.--Sound, away!
                   [_Exeunt all except Pembroke, Arundel, Gaveston, James
                       and other attendants of Pembroke._
_Pem._ My lord, you shall go with me:
   My house is not far hence; out of the way
   A little; but our men shall go along.
   We that have pretty wenches to our wives,
   Sir, must not come so near to balk their lips.
_Arun._ 'Tis very kindly spoke, my Lord of Pembroke:
   Your honour hath an adamant of power
   To draw a prince.
_Pem._ So, my lord.--Come hither, James:
   I do commit this Gaveston to thee;
   Be thou this night his keeper; in the morning
   We will discharge thee of thy charge: be gone.
_Gav._ Unhappy Gaveston, whither go'st thou now?
                     [_Exit with James and other Attendants of Pembroke._
_Horse-boy._ My lord, we'll quickly be at Cobham.              [_Exeunt._
