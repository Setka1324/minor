LIT. Good ga'mere Urse, Win and I are exceedingly beholden to you, and
to captain Jordan, and captain Whit.--Win, I'll be bold to leave you,
in this good company, Win; for half an hour or so, Win; while I go and
see how my matter goes forward, and if the puppets be perfect; and
then I'll come and fetch you, Win.
