NIGHT. _At plays, and at sermons, and at the sessions,
  'Tis daily their practice such booty to make.
  Yea under the gallows at executions,
  They stick not the stare-abouts' purses to take.
     Nay one without grace,
     At a [far] better place,
  At court, and in Christmas, before the king's face._
