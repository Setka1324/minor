_Dido._ May I entreate thee to discourse at large,
And truely to how _Troy_ was ouercome:
For many tales goe of that Cities fall,
And scarcely doe agree vpon one poynt:
Some say _Antenor_ did betray the towne,
Others report twas _Sinons_ periurie:
But all in this that _Troy_ is ouercome,
And _Priam_ dead, yet how we heare no newes.
