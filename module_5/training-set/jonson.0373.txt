   MACI.  O, how she tempts my heart-strings with her eye,
   To knit them to her beauties, or to break!
   What mov'd the heavens, that they could not make
   Me such a woman!  but a man, a beast,
   That hath no bliss like others?  Would to heaven,
   In wreak of my misfortunes, I were turn'd
   To some fair water-nymph, that set upon
   The deepest whirl-pit of the rav'nous seas,
   My adamantine eyes might headlong hale
   This iron world to me, and drown it all.
