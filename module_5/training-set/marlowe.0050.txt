     if thou'lt dance naked, put off thy clothes, and I'll conjure
     thee about presently; or, if thou'lt go but to the tavern with
     me, I'll give thee white wine, red wine, claret-wine, sack,
     muscadine, malmsey, and whippincrust, hold, belly, hold; [93] and
     we'll not pay one penny for it.
