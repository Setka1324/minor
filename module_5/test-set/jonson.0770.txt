   COURT-DISH, a kind of drinking-cup (Halliwell); N.E.D.
   quotes from Bp. Goodman's "Court of James I.": "The
   king...caused his carver to cut him out a court-dish,
   that is, something of every dish, which he sent him as
   part of his reversion," but this does not sound like
   short allowance or small receptacle.
