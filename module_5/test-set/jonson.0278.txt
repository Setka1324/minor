   ASP.  [TURNING TO THE STAGE.]
   I not observed this thronged round till now!
   Gracious and kind spectators, you are welcome;
   Apollo and Muses feast your eyes
   With graceful objects, and may our Minerva
   Answer your hopes, unto their largest strain!
   Yet here mistake me not, judicious friends;
   I do not this, to beg your patience,
   Or servilely to fawn on your applause,
   Like some dry brain, despairing in his merit.
   Let me be censured by the austerest brow,
   Where I want art or judgment, tax me freely.
   Let envious censors, with their broadest eyes,
   Look through and through me, I pursue no favour;
   Only vouchsafe me your attentions,
   And I will give you music worth your ears.
   O, how I hate the monstrousness of time,
   Where every servile imitating spirit,
   Plagued with an itching leprosy of wit,
   In a mere halting fury, strives to fling
   His ulcerous body in the Thespian spring,
   And straight leaps forth a poet!  but as lame
   As Vulcan, or the founder of Cripplegate.
