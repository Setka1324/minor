   TRUE: Why, did you ever hope, sir, committing the secrecy of it to
   a barber, that less then the whole town should know it? you might
   as well have told it the conduit, or the bake-house, or the
   infantry that follow the court, and with more security. Could
   your gravity forget so old and noted a remnant, as lippis et
   tonsoribus notum? Well, sir, forgive it yourself now, the fault,
   and be communicable with your friends. Here will be three or four
   fashionable ladies from the college to visit you presently, and
   their train of minions and followers.
