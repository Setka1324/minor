   TRUE: Do not fear me. Clap but a civil gown with a welt on the
   one; and a canonical cloak with sleeves on the other: and give
   them a few terms in their mouths, if there come not forth as able
   a doctor, and complete a parson, for this turn, as may be wish'd,
   trust not my election: and, I hope, without wronging the dignity
   of either profession, since they are but persons put on, and for
   mirth's sake, to torment him. The barber smatters Latin, I
   remember.
