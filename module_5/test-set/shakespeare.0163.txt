    So in Decker's Knight's Conjuring, &c. "If any of them had bound
    the spirit of gold by any charmes _in cares_, or in iron fetters,
    _under the ground_, they should, _for their own soule's quiet
    (which, questionless, else would whine up and down_,) not for the
    good of their children, release it."]
