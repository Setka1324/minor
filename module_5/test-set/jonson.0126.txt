NIGHT. _But O, you vile nation of cut-purses all,
  Relent and repent, and amend and be sound,
  And know that you ought not, by honest men's fall,
  Advance your own fortunes, to die above ground;
     And though you go gay
     In silks, as you may,
  It is not the highway to heaven (as they say).
  Repent then, repent you, for better, for worse,
  And kiss not the gallows for cutting a purse.
  Youth, youth, thou had'st better been starv'd by thy nurse,
  Than live to be hang'd for cutting a purse._
