LEATH. O no:
  Between you and I, sir, we do but make show.--
  _Thus, gentles, you perceive, without any denial,
  'Twixt Damon and Pythias here, friendship's true trial.
  Though hourly they quarrel thus, and roar each with other.
  They fight you no more than does brother with brother;
  But friendly together, at the next man they meet,
  They let fly their anger, as here you might see't._
