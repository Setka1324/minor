   FAL.  Oh, sweet Fastidious Brisk!  O fine courtier!  thou are he makest me
   sigh, and say, how blessed is that woman that hath a courtier to her
   husband, and how miserable a dame she is, that hath neither husband, nor
   friend in the court!  O sweet Fastidious!  O fine courtier!  How comely he
   bows him in his court'sy!  how full he hits a woman between the lips when
   he kisses!  how upright he sits at the table!  how daintily he carves!  how
   sweetly he talks, and tells news of this lord and of that lady!  how
   cleanly he wipes his spoon at every spoonful of any whitemeat he eats!  and
   what a neat case of pick-tooths he carries about him still!  O sweet
   Fastidious!  O fine courtier!
