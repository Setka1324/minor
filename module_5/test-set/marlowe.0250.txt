   RAMUS. Not for my life doe I desire this pause,
   But in my latter houre to purge my selfe,
   In that I know the things that I have wrote,
   Which as I heare one Shekins takes it ill,
   Because my places being but three, contain all his:
   I knew the Organon to be confusde,
   And I reduc'd it into better forme.
   And this for Aristotle will I say,
   That he that despiseth him, can nere
   Be good in Logick or Philosophie.
   And thats because the blockish Sorbonests
   Attribute as much unto their workes,
   As to the service of the eternall God.
