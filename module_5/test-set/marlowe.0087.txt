          Sennet.  Enter, at one door, [158] the EMPEROR ALEXANDER, at
          the other, DARIUS.  They meet.  DARIUS is thrown down;
          ALEXANDER kills him, takes off his crown, and, offering to
          go out, his PARAMOUR meets him.  He embraceth her, and sets
          DARIUS' crown upon her head; and, coming back, both salute
          the EMPEROR, who, leaving his state, [159] offers to embrace
          them; which FAUSTUS seeing, suddenly stays him.  Then trumpets
          cease, and music sounds.
