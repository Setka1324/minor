   DELI.  Believe me, Macilente, this is gospel.
   O, that a man were his own man so much,
   To rule himself thus.  I will strive, i'faith,
   To be more strange and careless; yet I hope
   I have now taken such a perfect course,
   To make her kind to me, and live contented,
   That I shall find my kindness well return'd,
   And have no need to fight with my affections.
   She late hath found much fault with every room
   Within my house; one was too big, she said,
   Another was not furnish'd to her mind,
   And so through all; all which, now, I have alter'd.
   Then here, she hath a place, on my back-side,
   Wherein she loves to walk; and that, she said,
   Had some ill smells about it:  now, this walk
   Have I before she knows it, thus perfumed
   With herbs, and flowers; and laid in divers places,
   As 'twere on altars consecrate to her,
   Perfumed gloves, and delicate chains of amber,
   To keep the air in awe of her sweet nostrils:
   This have I done, and this I think will please her.
   Behold, she comes.
