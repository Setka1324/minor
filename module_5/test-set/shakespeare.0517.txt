Both stile and gate, horseway and footpath. Poor Tom hath been
scared out of his good wits. Bless thee, good manâ€™s son, from
the foul fiend! Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once; of

stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and
mowing, who since possesses chambermaids and waiting women. So,
bless thee, master!
