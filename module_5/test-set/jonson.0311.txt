   MAC.  Ay, when I cannot shun you, we will meet.
   'Tis strange!  of all the creatures I have seen,
   I envy not this Buffone, for indeed
   Neither his fortunes nor his parts deserve it:
   But I do hate him, as I hate the devil,
   Or that brass-visaged monster Barbarism.
   O, 'tis an open-throated, black-mouth'd cur,
   That bites at all, but eats on those that feed him.
   A slave, that to your face will, serpent-like,
   Creep on the ground, as he would eat the dust,
   And to your back will turn the tail, and sting
   More deadly than the scorpion:  stay, who's this?
   Now, for my soul, another minion
   Of the old lady Chance's!  I'll observe him.
