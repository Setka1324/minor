     MEPHIST. All's one, for we'll be bold with his venison.
     But now, my Faustus, that thou mayst perceive
     What Rome contains for to delight thine eyes,
     Know that this city stands upon seven hills
     That underprop the groundwork of the same:
     Just through [106] the midst runs flowing Tiber's stream,
     With winding banks that cut it in two parts;
     Over the which two stately bridges lean,
     That make safe passage to each part of Rome:
     Upon the bridge call'd Ponte [107] Angelo
     Erected is a castle passing strong,
     Where thou shalt see such store of ordnance,
     As that the double cannons, forg'd of brass,
     Do match [108] the number of the days contain'd
     Within the compass of one complete year;
     Beside the gates, and high pyramides,
     That Julius Caesar brought from Africa.
