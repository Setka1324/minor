   SORD.  From my son, sir!  what would my son, sir?  some good news, no doubt.
   [READS.
   "Sweet and dear father, desiring you first to send me your blessing, which
   is more worth to me than gold or silver, I desire you likewise to be
   advertised, that this Shrove-tide, contrary to custom, we use always to
   have revels; which is indeed dancing, and makes an excellent shew in truth;
   especially if we gentlemen be well attired, which our seniors note, and
   think the better of our fathers, the better we are maintained, and that
   they shall know if they come up, and have anything to do in the law;
   therefore, good father, these are, for your own sake as well as mine, to
   re-desire you, that you let me not want that which is fit for the setting
   up of our name, in the honourable volume of gentility, that I may say to
   our calumniators, with Tully, 'Ego sum ortus domus meae, tu occasus tuae.'
   And thus, not doubting of your fatherly benevolence, I humbly ask your
   blessing, and pray God to bless you.
   Yours, if his own," [FUNGOSO.]
   How's this!  "Yours, if his own!"  Is he not my son, except he be his own
   son?  belike this is some new kind of subscription the gallants use.  Well!
   wherefore dost thou stay, knave?  away; go.
   [EXIT HIND.]
   Here's a letter, indeed!  revels?  and benevolence?  is this a weather to
   send benevolence?  or is this a season to revel in?  'Slid, the devil and
   all takes part to vex me, I think!  this letter would never have come now
   else, now, now, when the sun shines, and the air thus clear.  Soul!  If
   this hold, se shall shortly have an excellent crop of corn spring out of
   the high ways:  the streets and houses of the town will be hid with the
   rankness of the fruits, that grow there in spite of good husbandry.  Go to,
   I'll prevent the sight of it, come as quickly as it can, I will prevent the
   sight of it.  I have this remedy, heaven.
   [CLAMBERS UP, AND SUSPENDS THE HALTER TO A TREE.]
   Stay; I'll try the pain thus a little.  O, nothing, nothing.  Well now!
   shall my son gain a benevolence by my death?  or anybody be the better for
   my gold, or so forth?  no; alive I kept it from them, and dead, my ghost
   shall walk about it, and preserve it.  My son and daughter shall starve ere
   they touch it; I have hid it as deep as hell from the sight of heaven, and
   to it I go now.
   [FLINGS HIMSELF OFF.
