   HAU: I assure you, sir Dauphine, it is the price and estimation
   of your virtue only, that hath embark'd me to this adventure; and
   I could not but make out to tell you so; nor can I repent me of
   the act, since it is always an argument of some virtue in our
   selves, that we love and affect it so in others.
