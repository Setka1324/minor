   NAVARRE. It will not countervaile his paines I hope,
   I would the Guise in his steed might have come,
   But he doth lurke within his drousie couch,
   And makes his footstoole on securitie:
   So he be safe he cares not what becomes,
   Of King or Country, no not for them both.
   But come my Lords, let us away with speed,
   And place our selves in order for the fight.
