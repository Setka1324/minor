   FUNG.  Faith, I cannot tell, sister; but if a man had any true melancholy
   in him, it would make him melancholy to see his yeomanly father cut his
   neighbours' throats, to make his son a gentleman; and yet, when he has cut
   them, he will see his son's throat cut too, ere he make him a true
   gentleman indeed, before death cut his own throat.  I must be the first
   head of our house, and yet he will not give me the head till I be made so.
   Is any man termed a gentleman, that is not always in the fashion?  I would
   know but that.
