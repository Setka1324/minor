   TRUE: O, are you here? Come, Dauphine; go call your uncle
   presently: I have fitted my divine, and my canonist, dyed
   their beards and all. The knaves do not know themselves, they
   are so exalted and altered. Preferment changes any man. Thou
   shalt keep one door and I another, and then Clerimont in the
   midst, that he may have no means of escape from their cavilling,
   when they grow hot once again. And then the women, as I have
   given the bride her instructions, to break in upon him in the
   l'enuoy. O, 'twill be full and twanging! Away! fetch him.

   Come, master doctor, and master parson, look to your parts now,
   and discharge them bravely: you are well set forth, perform it
   as well. If you chance to be out, do not confess it with standing
   still, or humming, or gaping one at another: but go on, and talk
   aloud and eagerly; use vehement action, and only remember your
   terms, and you are safe. Let the matter go where it will: you
   have many will do so. But at first be very solemn, and grave like
   your garments, though you loose your selves after, and skip out
   like a brace of jugglers on a table. Here he comes: set your
   faces, and look superciliously, while I present you.
