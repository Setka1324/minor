   EPERNOUNE. But trust him not my Lord,
   For had your highnesse seene with what a pompe
   He entred Paris, and how the Citizens
   With gifts and shewes did entertaine him
   And promised to be at his commaund:
   Nay, they fear'd not to speak in the streetes,
   That Guise ch, durst stand in armes against the King,
   For not effecting of his holines will.
