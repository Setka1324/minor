   OTT: Wife! buz! titivilitium! There's no such thing in nature.
   I confess, gentlemen, I have a cook, a laundress, a house-drudge,
   that serves my necessary turns, and goes under that title: but
   he's an ass that will be so uxorious to tie his affections to one
   circle. Come, the name dulls appetite. Here, replenish again:
   another bout.
   [FILLS THE CUPS AGAIN.]
   Wives are nasty sluttish animalls.
