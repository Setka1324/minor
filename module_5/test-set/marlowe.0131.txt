     EVIL ANGEL. Now, Faustus, let thine eyes with horror stare
          [Hell is discovered.]
     Into that vast perpetual torture-house:
     There are the Furies tossing damned souls
     On burning forks; there bodies boil [256] in lead;
     There are live quarters broiling on the coals,
     That ne'er can die; this ever-burning chair
     Is for o'er-tortur'd souls to rest them in;
     These that are fed with sops of flaming fire,
     Were gluttons, and lov'd only delicates,
     And laugh'd to see the poor starve at their gates:
     But yet all these are nothing; thou shalt see
     Ten thousand tortures that more horrid be.
