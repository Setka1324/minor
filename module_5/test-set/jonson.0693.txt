   TRUE: Peace, rascals! You see who's your friend now, sir: take
   courage, put on a martyr's resolution. Mock down all their
   attemptings with patience: 'tis but a day, and I would suffer
   heroically. Should an ass exceed me in fortitude? no. You betray
   your infirmity with your hanging dull ears, and make them insult:
   bear up bravely, and constantly.

   --Look you here, sir, what honour is done you unexpected, by your
   nephew; a wedding-dinner come, and a knight-sewer before it, for
   the more reputation: and fine mistress Otter, your neighbour, in
   the rump, or tail of it.
