  _Laer._ (R.) It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
  No medicine in the world can do thee good,
  In thee there is not half an hour's life;
  The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
  Unbated and envenom'd:[77] the foul practice[78]
  Hath turn'd itself on me; lo, here I lie,
  Never to rise again: Thy mother's poison'd:
  I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.
