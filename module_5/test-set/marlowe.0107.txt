     HORSE-COURSER. Now, sirs, you shall hear how villanously he
     served me.  I went to him yesterday to buy a horse of him, and
     he would by no means sell him under forty dollars.  So, sir,
     because I knew him to be such a horse as would run over hedge
     and ditch and never tire, I gave him his money.  So, when I had
     my horse, Doctor Faustus bad me ride him night and day, and spare
     him no time; but, quoth he, in any case, ride him not into the
     water.  Now, sir, I thinking the horse had had some quality [208]
     that he would not have me know of, what did I but rid [209] him
     into a great river? and when I came just in the midst, my horse
     vanished away, and I sate straddling upon a bottle of hay.
