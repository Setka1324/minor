_Æn._ O th'inchaunting words of that base slaue,
Made him to thinke _Epeus_ pine-tree Horse
A sacrifize t'appease _Mineruas_ wrath:
The rather for that one _Laocoon_
Breaking a speare vpon his hollow breast,
Was with two winged Serpents stung to death.
Whereat agast, we were commanded straight
With reuerence to draw it into _Troy_.
In which vnhappie worke was I employd,
These hands did helpe to hale it to the gates,
Through which it could not enter twas so huge.
O had it neuer entred, _Troy_ had stood.
But _Priamus_ impatient of delay,
Inforst a wide breach in that rampierd wall,
Which thousand battering Rams could neuer pierce,
And so came in this fatall instrument:
At whose accursed feete as ouerioyed,
We banquetted till ouercome with wine,
Some surfetted, and others soundly slept.
Which _Sinon_ viewing, causde the Greekish spyes
To hast to _Tenedos_ and tell the Campe:
Then he vnlockt the Horse, and suddenly
From out his entrailes, _Neoptolemus_
Setting his speare vpon the ground, leapt forth,
And after him a thousand Grecians more,
In whose sterne faces shin'd the quenchles fire,
That after burnt the pride of _Asia_.
By this the Campe was come vnto the walles,
And through the breach did march into the streetes,
Where meeting with the rest, kill kill they cryed.
Frighted with this confused noyse, I rose,
And looking from a turret, might behold
Yong infants swimming in their parents bloud,
Headles carkasses piled vp in heapes,
Virgins halfe dead dragged by their golden haire,
And with maine force flung on a ring of pikes,
Old men with swords thrust through their aged sides,
Kneeling for mercie to a Greekish lad,
Who with steele Pol-axes dasht out their braines.
Then buckled I mine armour, drew my sword,
And thinking to goe downe, came _Hectors_ ghost
With ashie visage, blewish, sulphure eyes,
His armes torne from his shoulders, and his breast
Furrowd with wounds, and that which made me weepe,
Thongs at his heeles, by which _Achilles_ horse
Drew him in triumph through the Greekish Campe,
Burst from the earth, crying, _Æneas_ flye,
_Troy_ is a fire, the Grecians haue the towne,
