   FAST.  As true noble a gentleman too as any breathes; I am exceedingly
   endear'd to his love:  By this hand, I protest to you, signior, I speak it
   not gloriously, nor out of affectation, but there's he and the count
   Frugale, signior Illustre, signior Luculento, and a sort of 'em, that when
   I am at court, they do share me amongst them; happy is he can enjoy me most
   private.  I do wish myself sometime an ubiquitary for their love, in good
   faith.
