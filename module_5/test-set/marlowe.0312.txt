_Iup._ What ist sweet wagge I should deny thy youth?
Whose face reflects such pleasure to mine eyes,
As I exhal'd with thy fire darting beames,
Haue oft driuen backe the horses of the night.
When as they would haue hal'd thee from my sight:
Sit on my knee, and call for thy content,
Controule proud Fate, and cut the thred of time,
Why are not all the Gods at thy commaund,
And heauen and earth the bounds of thy delight?
_Vulcan_ shall daunce to make thee laughing sport,
And my nine Daughters sing when thou art sad,
From _Iunos_ bird Ile pluck her spotted pride,
To make thee fannes wherewith to coole thy face,
And _Venus_ Swannes shall shed their siluer downe,
To sweeten out the slumbers of thy bed:
_Hermes_ no more shall shew the world his wings,
If that thy fancie in his feathers dwell,
But as this one Ile teare them all from him,
Doe thou but say their colour pleaseth me:
Hold here my little loue these linked gems,
My _Iuno_ ware vpon her marriage day,
Put thou about thy necke my owne sweet heart,
And tricke thy armes and shoulders with my theft.
