   FAST.  Good signior Macilente, if this gentleman, signior Deliro, furnish
   you, as he says he will, with clothes, I will bring you, to-morrow by this
   time, into the presence of the most divine and acute lady in court; you
   shall see sweet silent rhetorick, and dumb eloquence speaking in her eye,
   but when she speaks herself, such an anatomy of wit, so sinewised and
   arterised, that 'tis the goodliest model of pleasure that ever was to
   behold.  Oh!  she strikes the world into admiration of her; O, O, O!  I
   cannot express them, believe me.
