   But first lets follow those in France.
   That hinder our possession to the crowne:
   As Caesar to his souldiers, so say I:
   Those that hate me, will I learn to loath.
   Give me a look, that when I bend the browes,
   Pale death may walke in furrowes of my face:
   A hand, that with a graspe may gripe the world,
   An eare, to heare what my detractors say,
   A royall seate, a scepter and a crowne:
   That those which doe behold them may become
   As men that stand and gase against the Sunne.
   The plot is laide, and things shall come to passe,
   Where resolution strives for victory.
