    [Footnote IV.26: _There's fennel for you, and columbines:_]
    Fennel was considered an emblem of flattery, and columbine was
    anciently supposed to be a _thankless flower_; signifying
    probably that the courtiers flattered to get favours, and were
    thankless after receiving them. Columbine was emblematical of
    forsaken lovers.]
