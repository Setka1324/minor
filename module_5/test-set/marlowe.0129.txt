     MEPHIST. I do confess it, Faustus, and rejoice:
     'Twas I that, when thou wert i'the way to heaven,
     Damm'd up thy passage; when thou took'st the book
     To view the Scriptures, then I turn'd the leaves,
     And led thine eye. [251]
     What, weep'st thou? 'tis too late; despair!  Farewell:
     Fools that will laugh on earth must weep in hell.
          [Exit.] [252]
