   LADY.  Sir knight, albeit it be not usual with me, chiefly in the absence
   of a husband, to admit any entrance to strangers, yet in the true regard of
   those innated virtues, and fair parts, which so strive to express
   themselves, in you; I am resolved to entertain you to the best of my
   unworthy power; which I acknowledge to be nothing, valued with what so
   worthy a person may deserve.  Please you but stay while I descend.
