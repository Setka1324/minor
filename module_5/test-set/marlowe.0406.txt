_Dido._ Hast thou forgot how many neighbour kings
Were vp in armes, for making thee my loue?
How _Carthage_ did rebell, _Iarbus_ storme,
And all the world calles me a second _Helen_,
For being intangled by a strangers lookes:
So thou wouldst proue as true as _Paris_ did,
Would, as faire _Troy_ was, _Carthage_ might be sackt,
And I be calde a second _Helena_.
Had I a sonne by thee, the griefe were lesse,
That I might see _Ã†neas_ in his face:
Now if thou goest, what canst thou leaue behind,
But rather will augment then ease my woe?
