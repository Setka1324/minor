   MACI.  I fain would know of heaven now, why yond fool
   Should wear a suit of satin?  he?  that rook,
   That painted jay, with such a deal of outside:
   What is his inside, trow?  ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
   Good heavens, give me patience, patience, patience.
   A number of these popinjays there are,
   Whom, if a man confer, and but examine
   Their inward merit, with such men as want;
   Lord, lord, what things they are!
