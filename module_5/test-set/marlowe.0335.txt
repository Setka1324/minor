_Illio._ Louely _Ã†neas_, these are Carthage walles,
And here Queene _Dido_ weares th'imperiall Crowne,
Who for _Troyes_ sake hath entertaind vs all,
And clad vs in these wealthie robes we weare.
Oft hath she askt vs vnder whom we seru'd,
And when we told her she would weepe for griefe,
Thinking the sea had swallowed vp thy ships,
And now she sees thee how will she reioyce?
