   TRUE: Marry, your friends do wonder, sir, the Thames being so near,
   wherein you may drown, so handsomely; or London-bridge, at a low
   fall, with a fine leap, to hurry you down the stream; or, such a
   delicate steeple, in the town as Bow, to vault from; or, a braver
   height, as Paul's; Or, if you affected to do it nearer home, and a
   shorter way, an excellent garret-window into the street; or, a
   beam in the said garret, with this halter
   [HE SHEWS HIM A HALTER.]--
   which they have sent, and desire, that you would sooner commit your
   grave head to this knot, than to the wedlock noose; or, take a
   little sublimate, and go out of the world like a rat; or a fly,
   as one said, with a straw in your arse: any way, rather than to
   follow this goblin Matrimony. Alas, sir, do you ever think to
   find a chaste wife in these times? now? when there are so many
   masques, plays, Puritan preachings, mad folks, and other strange
   sights to be seen daily, private and public? If you had lived
   in king Ethelred's time, sir, or Edward the Confessor, you might,
   perhaps, have found one in some cold country hamlet, then, a dull
   frosty wench, would have been contented with one man: now, they
   will as soon be pleased with one leg, or one eye. I'll tell you,
   sir, the monstrous hazards you shall run with a wife.
