   MOR: Salute them! I had rather do any thing, than wear out time so
   unfruitfully, sir. I wonder how these common forms, as God save
   you, and You are welcome, are come to be a habit in our lives:
   or, I am glad to see you! when I cannot see what the profit can
   be of these words, so long as it is no whit better with him whose
   affairs are sad and grievous, that he hears this salutation.
