   NAVARRE. And thats the cause that Guise so frowns at us,
   And beates his braines to catch us in his trap,
   Which he hath pitcht within his deadly toyle.
   Come my Lords lets go to the Church and pray,
   That God may still defend the right of France:
   And make his Gospel flourish in this land.
