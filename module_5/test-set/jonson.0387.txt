   COR.  Ay, and they are well met, for 'tis as dry an Orange as ever grew:
   nothing but salutation, and "O lord, sir!" and "It pleases you to say so,
   sir!"  one that can laugh at a jest for company with a most plausible and
   extemporal grade; and some hour after in private ask you what it was.  The
   other monsieur, Clove, is a more spiced youth; he will sit you a whole
   afternoon sometimes in a bookseller's shop, reading the Greek, Italian, and
   Spanish, when he understands not a word of either; if he had the tongues to
   his suits, he were an excellent linguist.
