_Æn._ Of _Troy_ am I, _Æneas_ is my name,
Who driuen by warre from forth my natiue world,
Put sailes to sea to seeke out _Italy_;
And my diuine descent from sceptred _Iove_,
With twise twelue Phrigian ships I plowed the deepe,
And made that way my mother _Venus_ led:
But of them all scarce seuen doe anchor safe,
And they so wrackt and weltred by the waues,
As euery tide tilts twixt their oken sides:
And all of them vnburdened of their loade,
Are ballassed with billowes watrie weight.
But haples I, God wot, poore and vnknowne,
Doe trace these Libian deserts all despisde,
Exild forth _Europe_ and wide _Asia_ both,
And haue not any couerture but heauen.
