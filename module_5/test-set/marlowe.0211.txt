_Mat._ Guard the king sure: it is the Earl of Kent.
_K. Edw._ O gentle brother, help to rescue me!
_Mat._ Keep them asunder; thrust in the king.
_Kent._ Soldiers, let me but talk to him one word.
_Gur._ Lay hands upon the earl for his assault.
_Kent._ Lay down your weapons, traitors! yield the king!
_Mat._ Edmund, yield thou thyself, or thou shalt die.
_Kent._ Base villains, wherefore do you gripe me thus?
_Gur._ Bind him, and so convey him to the court.
_Kent._ Where is the court but here? here is the king
   And I will visit him: why stay you me?
_Mat._ The court is where Lord Mortimer remains:
   Thither shall your honour go; and so, farewell.
                          [_Exeunt Matrevis and Gurney with King Edward._
_Kent._ O, miserable is that common-weal,
   Where lords keep courts, and kings are lock'd in prison!
_First Sold._ Wherefore stay we? on, sirs, to the court!
_Kent._ Ay, lead me whither you will, even to my death,
   Seeing that my brother cannot be releas'd.                  [_Exeunt._
