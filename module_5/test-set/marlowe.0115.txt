     FAUSTUS. Gentlemen,
     For that I know your friendship is unfeign'd,
     It is not Faustus' custom to deny
     The just request of those that wish him well:
     You shall behold that peerless dame of Greece,
     No otherwise for pomp or majesty
     Than when Sir Paris cross'd the seas with her,
     And brought the spoils to rich Dardania.
     Be silent, then, for danger is in words.
