     EMPEROR. O, pardon me! my thoughts are so ravish'd
     With sight of this renowmed [161] emperor,
     That in mine arms I would have compass'd him.
     But, Faustus, since I may not speak to them,
     To satisfy my longing thoughts [162] at full,
     Let me this tell thee:  I have heard it said
     That this fair lady, whilst [163] she liv'd on earth,
     Had on her neck a little wart or mole;
     How may I prove that saying to be true?
