_K. Edw._ Thus, after many threats of wrathful war,
   Triumpheth England's Edward with his friends,
   And triumph Edward with his friends uncontroll'd!--
   My Lord of Glocester, do you hear the news?
_Y. Spen._ What news, my lord?
_K. Edw._ Why, man, they say there is great execution
   Done through the realm.--My Lord of Arundel,
   You have the note, have you not?
_Arun._From the Lieutenant of the Tower, my lord.
_K. Edw._ I pray, let us see it.          [_Takes the note from Arundel._
   --What have we there?--
   Read it, Spenser.
                             [_Gives the note to young Spenser, who reads
                                 their names._
   Why, so: they bark'd apace a month ago;
   Now, on my life, they'll neither bark nor bite.
   Now, sirs, the news from France?  Glocester, I trow,
   The lords of France love England's gold so well
   As Isabella gets no aid from thence.
   What now remains? have you proclaim'd, my lord,
   Reward for them can bring in Mortimer?
_Y. Spen._ My lord, we have; and, if he be in England,
   'A will be had ere long, I doubt it not.
_K. Edw._ If, dost thou say?  Spenser, as true as death,
   He is in England's ground: our port-masters
   Are not so careless of their king's command.
