  And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,
  Thou may'st not coldly set[6]
  Our sovereign process;[7] which imports at full,
  By letters conjuring to that effect,[8]
  The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
  For thou must cure me: 'Till I know 'tis done,
  Howe'er my haps,[9] my joys will ne'er begin.
