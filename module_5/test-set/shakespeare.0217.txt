    [Footnote II.56: _By the altitude of a chopine._] A chioppine is
    a high shoe, or rather clog, worn by the Italians. Venice was
    more famous for them than any other place. They are described as
    having been made of wood covered with coloured leather, and
    sometimes _even half a yard high_, their altitude being
    proportioned to the rank of the lady, so that they could not walk
    without being supported.]
