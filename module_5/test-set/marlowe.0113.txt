     WAGNER. I think my master [229] means to die shortly; he has made
     his will, and given me his wealth, his house, his goods, [230] and
     store of golden plate, besides two thousand ducats ready-coined.
     I wonder what he means:  if death were nigh, he would not frolic
     thus.  He's now at supper with the scholars, where there's such
     belly-cheer as Wagner in his life ne'er [231] saw the like:  and,
     see where they come! belike the feast is ended. [232]
