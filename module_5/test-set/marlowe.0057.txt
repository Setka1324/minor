     FAUSTUS. Nay, stay, my gentle Mephistophilis,
     And grant me my [113] request, and then I go.
     Thou know'st, within the compass of eight days
     We view'd the face of heaven, of earth, and hell;
     So high our dragons soar'd into the air,
     That, looking down, the earth appear'd to me
     No bigger than my hand in quantity;
     There did we view the kingdoms of the world,
     And what might please mine eye I there beheld.
     Then in this show let me an actor be,
     That this proud Pope may Faustus' cunning [114] see.
