_Light._ My Lord Protector greets you.                   [_Gives letter._
_Gur._ What's there?  I know not how to construe it.
_Mat._ Gurney, it was left unpointed for the nonce;
   _Edwardum occidere nolite timere,_
   That's his meaning.
_Light._ Know you this token?  I must have the king.      [_Gives token._
_Mat._ Ay, stay a while; thou shalt have answer straight.--
   This villain's sent to make away the king.
_Gur._ I thought as much.
_Mat._ And, when the murder's done,
   See how he must be handled for his labour,--
   _Pereat iste!_  Let him have the king;
   What else?--Here is the keys, this is the lake:
   Do as you are commanded by my lord.
_Light._ I know what I must do.  Get you away:
   Yet be not far off; I shall need your help:
   See that in the next room I have a fire,
   And get me a spit, and let it be red-hot.
_Mat._ Very well.
_Gur._ Need you anything besides?
_Light._ What else? a table and a feather-bed.
_Gur._ That's all?
_Light._ Ay, ay: so, when I call you, bring it in.
_Mat._ Fear not thou that.
_Gur._ Here's a light to go into the dungeon.
                [_Gives light to Lightborn, and then exit with Matrevis._
_Light._ So, now.
   Must I about this gear: ne'er was there any
   So finely handled as this king shall be.--
   Foh, here's a place indeed with all my heart!
_K. Edw._ Who's there? what light is that? wherefore com'st thou?
_Light._ To comfort you, and bring you joyful news.
_K. Edw._ Small comfort finds poor Edward in thy looks:
   Villain, I know thou com'st to murder me.
_Light._ To murder you, my most gracious lord?
   Far is it from my heart to do you harm.
   The queen sent me to see how you were us'd,
   For she relents at this your misery:
   And what eye can refrain from shedding tears,
   To see a king in this most piteous state?
_K. Edw._ Weep'st thou already? list a while to me,
   And then thy heart, were it as Gurney's is,
   Or as Matrevis', hewn from the Caucasus,
   Yet will it melt ere I have done my tale.
   This dungeon where they keep me is the sink
   Wherein the filth of all the castle falls.
_Light._ O villains!
_K. Edw._ And there, in mire and puddle, have I stood
   This ten days' space; and, lest that I should sleep,
   One plays continually upon a drum;
   They give me bread and water, being a king;
   So that, for want of sleep and sustenance,
   My mind's distemper'd, and my body's numb'd,
   And whether I have limbs or no I know not.
   O, would my blood dropp'd out from every vein,
   As doth this water from my tatter'd robes!
   Tell Isabel the queen, I look'd not thus,
   When for her sake I ran at tilt in France,
   And there unhors'd the Duke of Cleremont.
_Light._ O, speak no more, my lord! this breaks my heart.
   Lie on this bed, and rest yourself a while.
_K. Edw._ These looks of thine can harbour naught but death;
   I see my tragedy written in thy brows.
   Yet stay a while; forbear thy bloody hand,
   And let me see the stroke before it comes,
   That even then when I shall lose my life,
   My mind may be more steadfast on my God.
_Light._ What means your highness to mistrust me thus?
_K. Edw._ What mean'st thou to dissemble with me thus?
_Light._ These hands were never stain'd with innocent blood,
   Nor shall they now be tainted with a king's.
_K. Edw._ Forgive my thought for having such a thought.
   One jewel have I left; receive thou this:              [_Gives jewel._
   Still fear I, and I know not what's the cause,
   But every joint shakes as I give it thee.
   O, if thou harbour'st murder in thy heart,
   Let this gift change thy mind, and save thy soul!
   Know that I am a king: O, at that name
   I feel a hell of grief! where is my crown?
   Gone, gone! and do I [still] remain alive?
_Light._ You're overwatch'd, my lord: lie down and rest.
_K. Edw._ But that grief keeps me waking, I should sleep;
   For not these ten days have these eye-lids clos'd.
   Now, as I speak, they fall; and yet with fear
   Open again.  O, wherefore sitt'st thou here?
_Light._ If you mistrust me, I'll be gone, my lord.
_K. Edw._ No, no; for, if thou mean'st to murder me,
   Thou wilt return again; and therefore stay.                 [_Sleeps._
_Light._ He sleeps.
_K. Edw._ [_waking_] O, let me not die yet!  O, stay a while!
_Light._ How now, my lord!
_K. Edw._ Something still buzzeth in mine ears,
   And tells me, if I sleep, I never wake:
   This fear is that which makes me tremble thus;
   And therefore tell me, wherefore art thou come?
_Light._ To rid thee of thy life.--Matrevis, come!
