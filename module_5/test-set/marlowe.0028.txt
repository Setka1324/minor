     FAUSTUS. Wealth!
     Why, the signiory of Embden shall be mine.
     When Mephistophilis shall stand by me,
     What power can hurt me?  Faustus, thou art safe:
     Cast no more doubts.--Mephistophilis, come,
     And bring glad tidings from great Lucifer;--
     Is't not midnight?--come Mephistophilis,
     And bring glad tidings from great Lucifer;--
     Is't not midnight?--come Mephistophilis,
     Veni, veni, Mephistophile! [48]
