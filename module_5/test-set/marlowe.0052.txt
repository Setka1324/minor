     FAUSTUS. Having now, my good Mephistophilis,
     Pass'd with delight the stately town of Trier,
     Environ'd round [98] with airy mountain-tops,
     With walls of flint, and deep-entrenched lakes,
     Not to be won by any conquering prince;
     From Paris next, coasting the realm of France,
     We saw the river Maine fall into Rhine, [99]
     Whose banks are set with groves of fruitful vines;
     Then up to [100] Naples, rich Campania,
     Whose buildings fair and gorgeous to the eye,
     The streets straight forth, and pav'd with finest brick,
     Quarter the town in four equivalents: [101]
     There saw we learned Maro's golden tomb;
     The way he cut, an English mile in length,
     Thorough [102] a rock of stone, in one night's space;
     From thence to Venice, Padua, and the rest, [103]
     In one of which a sumptuous temple stands,
     That threats the stars with her aspiring top,
     Whose frame is pav'd with sundry-colour'd stones,
     And roof'd aloft with curious work in gold.
     Thus hitherto hath Faustus spent his time:
     But tell me [104] now, what resting-place is this?
     Hast thou, as erst I did command,
     Conducted me within the walls of Rome?
