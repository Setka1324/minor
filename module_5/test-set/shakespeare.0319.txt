    [Footnote IV.34: _No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his
    bones_,] Not only the sword, but the helmet, gauntlet, spurs, and
    tabard, (_i.e._, a coat whereon the armorial ensigns were
    anciently depicted, from whence the term _coat_ of armour), are
    hung over the grave of every knight.]
