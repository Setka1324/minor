   TRUE: Well, Dauphine, you have lurch'd your friends of the
   better half of the garland, by concealing this part of the
   plot: but much good do it thee, thou deserv'st it, lad. And,
   Clerimont, for thy unexpected bringing these two to
   confession, wear my part of it freely. Nay, sir Daw, and sir
   La-Foole, you see the gentlewoman that has done you the
   favours! we are all thankful to you, and so should the
   woman-kind here, specially for lying on her, though not
   with her! you meant so, I am sure? But that we have stuck it
   upon you to-day, in your own imagined persons, and so lately,
   this Amazon, the champion of the sex, should beat you now
   thriftily, for the common slanders which ladies receive from
   such cuckoos as you are. You are they that, when no merit or
   fortune can make you hope to enjoy their bodies, will yet
   lie with their reputations, and make their fame suffer. Away,
   you common moths of these, and all ladies' honours. Go,
   travel to make legs and faces, and come home with some new
   matter to be laugh'd at: you deserve to live in an air as
   corrupted as that wherewith you feed rumour.
   [EXEUNT DAW AND LA-FOOLE.]
   Madams, you are mute, upon this new metamorphosis! But here
   stands she that has vindicated your fames. Take heed of such
   insectae hereafter. And let it not trouble you, that you
   have discovered any mysteries to this young gentleman: he is
   almost of years, and will make a good visitant within this
   twelvemonth. In the mean time, we'll all undertake for his
   secrecy, that can speak so well of his silence.
   [COMING FORWARD.]
   --Spectators, if you like this comedy, rise cheerfully, and
   now Morose is gone in, clap your hands. It may be, that noise
   will cure him, at least please him.
   [EXEUNT.]
