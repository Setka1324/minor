_Dido._ Ile frame me wings of waxe like _Icarus_,
And ore his ships will soare vnto the Sunne,
That they may melt and I fall in his armes:
Or els Ile make a prayer vnto the waues,
That I may swim to him like _Tritons_ neece:
O _Anna_, fetch _Orions_ Harpe,
That I may tice a Dolphin to the shoare,
And ride vpon his backe vnto my loue:
Looke sister, looke louely _Æneas_ ships,
See see, the billowes heaue him vp to heauen,
And now downe falles the keeles into the deepe:
O sister, sister, take away the Rockes,
Theile breake his ships, O _Proteus_, _Neptune_, _Ioue_,
Saue, saue _Æneas_, _Didos_ leefest loue!
Now is he come on shoare safe without hurt:
But see, _Achates_ wils him put to sea,
And all the Sailers merrie make for ioy,
But he remembring me shrinkes backe againe:
See where he comes, welcome, welcome my loue.
