   CAR.  True, and the fashion is, when any stranger comes in amongst 'em,
   they all stand up and stare at him, as he were some unknown beast, brought
   out of Africk; but that will be helped with a good adventurous face.  You
   must be impudent enough, sit down, and use no respect:  when anything's
   propounded above your capacity smile at it, make two or three faces, and
   'tis excellent; they'll think you have travell'd; though you argue, a whole
   day, in silence thus, and discourse in nothing but laughter, 'twill pass.
   Only, now and then, give fire, discharge a good full oath, and offer a
   great wager; 'twill be admirable.
