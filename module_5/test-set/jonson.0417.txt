   SORD.  Nay, God's precious, if the weather and season be so respectless,
   that beggars shall live as well as their betters; and that my hunger and
   thirst for riches shall not make them hunger and thirst with poverty; that
   my sleep shall be broken, and their hearts not broken; that my coffers
   shall be full, and yet care; their's empty, and yet merry; -- 'tis time
   that a cross should bear flesh and blood, since flesh and blood cannot bear
   this cross.
