   CHARLES. Prince of Navarre my honourable brother,
   Prince Condy, and my good Lord Admirall,
   wishe this union and religious league,
   Knit in these hands, thus joyn'd in nuptiall rites,
   May not desolve, till death desolve our lives,
   And that the native sparkes of princely love,
   That kindled first this motion in our hearts,
   May still be feweld in our progenye.
