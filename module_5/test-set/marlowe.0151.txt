    "Mephistophilis, transform him straight: According to THE
     HISTORY OF DR. FAUSTUS, the knight was not present during
     Faustus's "conference" with the Emperor; nor did he offer
     the doctor any insult by doubting his skill in magic.  We
     are there told that Faustus happening to see the knight
     asleep, "leaning out of a window of the great hall," fixed
     a huge pair of hart's horns on his head; "and, as the knight
     awaked, thinking to pull in his head, he hit his hornes
     against the glasse, that the panes thereof flew about his
     eares:  thinke here how this good gentleman was vexed, for
     he could neither get backward nor forward."  After the emperor
     and the courtiers, to their great amusement, had beheld the
     poor knight in this condition, Faustus removed the horns.
     When Faustus, having taken leave of the emperor, was a league
     and a half from the city, he was attacked in a wood by the
     knight and some of his companions:  they were in armour, and
     mounted on fair palfreys; but the doctor quickly overcame
     them by turning all the bushes into horsemen, and "so
     charmed them, that every one, knight and other, for the
     space of a whole moneth, did weare a paire of goates
     hornes on their browes, and every palfry a paire of oxe
     hornes on his head; and this was their penance appointed
     by Faustus."  A second attempt of the knight to revenge
     himself on Faustus proved equally unsuccessful.  Sigs. G 2,
     I 3, ed. 1648." ]
