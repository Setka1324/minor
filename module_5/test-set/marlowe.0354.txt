_Iuno._ Here lyes my hate, _Ã†neas_ cursed brat,
The boy wherein false destinie delights,
The heire of furie, the fauorite of the face,
That vgly impe that shall outweare my wrath,
And wrong my deitie with high disgrace:
But I will take another order now,
And race th'eternall Register of time:
_Troy_ shall no more call him her second hope,
Nor _Venus_ triumph in his tender youth:
For here in spight of heauen Ile murder him,
And feede infection with his left out life:
Say _Paris_, now shall _Venus_ haue the ball?
Say vengeance, now shall her _Ascanius_ dye.
O no God wot, I cannot watch my time,
Nor quit good turnes with double fee downe told:
Tut, I am simple without made to hurt,
And haue no gall at all to grieue my foes:
But lustfull _Ioue_ and his adulterous child,
Shall finde it written on confusions front,
That onely _Iuno_ rules in _Rhamnuse_ towne.
