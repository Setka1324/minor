     FAUSTUS. Go, haste thee, gentle Mephistophilis,
     Follow the cardinals to the consistory;
     And, as they turn their superstitious books,
     Strike them with sloth and drowsy idleness,
     And make them sleep so sound, that in their shapes
     Thyself and I may parley with this [120] Pope,
     This proud confronter of the Emperor;
     And, in despite of all his holiness,
     Restore this Bruno to his liberty,
     And bear him to the states of Germany.
