   GUISE. Cosin tis he, I know him by his look.
   See where my Souldier shot him through the arm.
   He mist him neer, but we have strook him now.
   Ah base Shatillian and degenerate,
   Cheef standard bearer to the Lutheranes,
   Thus in despite of thy Religion,
   The Duke of Guise stampes on thy liveles bulke.
