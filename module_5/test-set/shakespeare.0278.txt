    [Footnote III.91: _Let the strucken deer go weep_,] Shakespeare,
    in _As you like it_, in allusion to the wounded stag, speaks of
    the _big round tears_ which _cours'd one another down his
    innocent nose in piteous chase_. In the 13th song of Drayton's
    Polyolbion, is a similar passage--"_The harte weepeth at his
    dying; his tears are held to be precious in medicine._"]
