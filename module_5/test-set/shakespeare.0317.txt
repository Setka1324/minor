    [Footnote IV.27: _There's rue for you; and here's some for
    me:--we may call it herb of grace o' Sundays:_] Probably a
    quibble is meant here, as _rue_ anciently signified the same as
    _ruth_, _i.e._, sorrow. In the common dictionaries of
    Shakespeare's time, it was called _herb of grace_. Ophelia wishes
    to remind the Queen of the sorrow and contrition she ought to
    feel for her unlawful marriage; and that she may wear her rue
    with peculiar propriety on Sundays, when she solicits pardon for
    the crime which she has so much occasion to _rue_ and repent
    of.--MALONE.]
