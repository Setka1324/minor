_Ã†n._ So much haue I receiu'd at _Didos_ hands,
As without blushing I can aske no more:
Yet Queene of _Affricke_, are my ships vnrigd,
My Sailes all rent in sunder with the winde,
My Oares broken, and my Tackling lost,
Yea all my Nauie split with Rockes and Shelfes:
Nor Sterne nor Anchor haue our maimed Fleete,
Our Masts the furious windes strooke ouer bourd:
Which piteous wants if _Dido_ will supplie,
We will account her author of our liues.
