   COR.  Ay!  what think you of Plautus, in his comedy called 'Cistellaria'?
   there, where he brings in Alcesimarchus with a drum sword ready to kill
   himself, and as he is e'en fixing his breast upon it, to be restrained from
   his resolved outrage, by Silenium and the bawd?  Is not his authority of
   power to give our scene approbation?
