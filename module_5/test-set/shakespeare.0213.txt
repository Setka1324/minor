    [Footnote II.50: _For the law of writ and the liberty, these are
    the only men._] The probable meaning of this passage is,--_For
    the observance of the rules of the Drama, while they take such
    liberties, as are allowable, they are the only men_--_writ_ is an
    old word for _writing_.]
