_Venus._ Such honour, stranger, doe I not affect:
It is the vse for Turen maides to weare
Their bowe and quiuer in this modest sort,
And suite themselues in purple for the nonce,
That they may trip more lightly ore the lawndes,
And ouertake the tusked Bore in chase.
But for the land whereof thou doest enquire,
It is the punick kingdome rich and strong,
Adioyning on _Agenors_ stately towne,
The kingly seate of Southerne _Libia_,
Whereas Sidonian _Dido_ rules as Queene.
But what are you that aske of me these things?
Whence may you come, or whither will you goe?
