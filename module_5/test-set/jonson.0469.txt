   SOG.  Why, I tell you, sir; he has been the only 'Bid-stand' that ever kept
   New-market, Salisbury-plain, Hockley i' the Hole, Gadshill, and all the
   high places of any request:  he has had his mares and his geldings, he,
   have been worth forty, threescore, a hundred pound a horse, would ha'
   sprung you over the hedge and ditch like your greyhound:  he has done five
   hundred robberies in his time, more or less, I assure you.
