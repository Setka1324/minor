_Y. Mor._ What traitor have we there with blades and bills?
_First Sold._ Edmund the Earl of Kent.
_K. Edw. Third._ What hath he done?
_First Sold._ 'A would have taken the king away perforce,
   As we were bringing him to Killingworth.
_Y. Mor._ Did you attempt his rescue, Edmund? speak.
_Kent._ Mortimer, I did: he is our king,
   And thou compell'st this prince to wear the crown.
_Y. Mor._ Strike off his head: he shall have martial law.
_Kent._ Strike off my head! base traitor, I defy thee!
_K. Edw. Third._ My lord, he is my uncle, and shall live.
_Y. Mor._ My lord, he is your enemy, and shall die.
_Kent._ Stay, villains!
_K. Edw. Third._ Sweet mother, if I cannot pardon him,
   Entreat my Lord Protector for his life.
_Q. Isab._ Son, be content: I dare not speak a word.
_K. Edw. Third._ Nor I; and yet methinks I should command:
   But, seeing I cannot, I'll entreat for him.--
   My lord, if you will let my uncle live,
   I will requite it when I come to age.
_Y. Mor._ 'Tis for your highness' good and for the realm's.--
   How often shall I bid you bear him hence?
_Kent._ Art thou king? must I die at thy command?
_Y. Mor._ At our command.--Once more, away with him!
_Kent._ Let me but stay and speak; I will not go:
   Either my brother or his son is king,
   And none of both them thirst for Edmund's blood:
   And therefore, soldiers, whither will you hale me?
                [_Soldiers hale Kent away, and carry him to be beheaded._
_K. Edw. Third._ What safety may I look for at his hands,
   If that my uncle shall be murder'd thus?
_Q. Isab._ Fear not, sweet boy; I'll guard thee from thy foes:
   Had Edmund liv'd, he would have sought thy death.
   Come, son, we'll ride a-hunting in the park.
_K. Edw. Third._ And shall my uncle Edmund ride with us?
_Q. Isab._ He is a traitor; think not on him: come.            [_Exeunt._
