   TRUE: 'Tis true; no more than all birds, or all fishes. If you
   appear learned to an ignorant wench, or jocund to a sad, or witty
   to a foolish, why she presently begins to mistrust herself. You
   must approach them in their own height, their own line: for the
   contrary makes many, that fear to commit themselves to noble and
   worthy fellows, run into the embraces of a rascal. If she love
   wit, give verses, though you borrow them of a friend, or buy them,
   to have good. If valour, talk of your sword, and be frequent in
   the mention of quarrels, though you be staunch in fighting. If
   activity, be seen on your barbary often, or leaping over stools,
   for the credit of your back. If she love good clothes or dressing,
   have your learned council about you every morning, your French
   tailor, barber, linener, etc. Let your powder, your glass, and
   your comb be your dearest acquaintance. Take more care for the
   ornament of your head, than the safety: and wish the commonwealth
   rather troubled, than a hair about you. That will take her. Then,
   if she be covetous and craving, do you promise any thing, and
   perform sparingly; so shall you keep her in appetite still. Seem
   as you would give, but be like a barren field, that yields little,
   or unlucky dice to foolish and hoping gamesters. Let your gifts
   be slight and dainty, rather than precious. Let cunning be above
   cost. Give cherries at time of year, or apricots; and say they
   were sent you out of the country, though you bought them in
   Cheapside. Admire her tires: like her in all fashions; compare her
   in every habit to some deity; invent excellent dreams to flatter
   her, and riddles; or, if she be a great one, perform always the
   second parts to her: like what she likes, praise whom she praises,
   and fail not to make the household and servants yours, yea the
   whole family, and salute them by their names: ('tis but light cost
   if you can purchase them so,) and make her physician your
   pensioner, and her chief woman. Nor will it be out of your gain to
   make love to her too, so she follow, not usher her lady's
   pleasure. All blabbing is taken away, when she comes to be a part
   of the crime.
