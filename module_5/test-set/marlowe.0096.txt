     FAUSTUS. Nay, keep it:  Faustus will have heads and hands,
     Ay, all [189] your hearts to recompense this deed.
     Knew you not, traitors, I was limited
     For four-and-twenty years to breathe on earth?
     And, had you cut my body with your swords,
     Or hew'd this flesh and bones as small as sand,
     Yet in a minute had my spirit return'd,
     And I had breath'd a man, made free from harm.
     But wherefore do I dally my revenge?--
     Asteroth, Belimoth, Mephistophilis?
