   MOR: Nay, good gentlemen, do not throw me into circumstances. Let
   your comforts arrive quickly at me, those that are. Be swift in
   affording me my peace, if so I shall hope any. I love not your
   disputations, or your court-tumults. And that it be not strange to
   you, I will tell you: My father, in my education, was wont to
   advise me, that I should always collect and contain my mind, not
   suffering it to flow loosely; that I should look to what things
   were necessary to the carriage of my life, and what not; embracing
   the one and eschewing the other: in short, that I should endear
   myself to rest, and avoid turmoil: which now is grown to be
   another nature to me. So that I come not to your public pleadings,
   or your places of noise; not that I neglect those things that make
   for the dignity of the commonwealth: but for the mere avoiding
   of clamours and impertinencies of orators, that know not how to be
   silent. And for the cause of noise, am I now a suitor to you. You
   do not know in what a misery I have been exercised this day, what
   a torrent of evil! my very house turns round with the tumult! I
   dwell in a windmill: The perpetual motion is here, and not at
   Eltham.
